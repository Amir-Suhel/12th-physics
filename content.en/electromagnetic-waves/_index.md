and properties of various things from atom to universe. Without light, even our eyes cannot see objects. What is light?. This puzzle made many physicists sleepless until middle of 19th century. Earlier, many scientists thought that optics and electromagnetism are two different branches of physics. But from the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who actually enlightened the concept of light from his theoretical prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave which moves with the speed equal to 3 × 108 ms–1 (in free space or vacuum). Later, it was confirmed that visible light is just only small portion of electromagnetic spectrum, which ranges from gamma rays to radio waves.

In unit 4, we studied that time varying magnetic field produces an electric field (Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction). Maxwell strongly believed that nature must possess symmetry and he asked




  

the following question, “when the time varying magnetic field produces an electric field, why not the time varying electric field produce a magnetic field?”

**Symmetry in nature**

Later he proved that it is indeed true. In 1888, H. Hertz experimentally verified Maxwell’s prediction and hence, this understanding resulted in new technological invention, especially in wireless communication, LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technology, RADAR (Radio Detection And Ranging) etc.

In today's digital world, cell phones (Figure 5.2 (a)) have greater influence in our day to day life. It is a faster and more effective mode of transferring information from one place to another. It works on the basis that light is an electromagnetic wave. In hospitals, the location of bone fracture can be detected using X-rays as shown in Figure 5.2 (b), which is also an electromagnetic wave. For cooking microwave oven is used. The microwave is also an electromagnetic wave. There are plenty of applications of electromagnetic waves in engineering, medicine (example LASER surgery, etc), defence (example, RADAR signals) and also in fundamental scientific research. In this unit, basics of electromagnetic waves are discussed.

### Displacement current and Maxwell’s correction to Ampere's circuital law

**Induced magnetic field** Faraday’s law of electromagnetic

induction states that the change in magnetic field produces an electric field. Mathematically, it is written as

_E dl d dt_

_d dt_

_B dA l_

_B S_

− −==∫ ∫Φ. . (5.1)

Electric field

with time

Changing magnetic flux ΦB in the region enclosed by the loop

where ΦB is the magnetic flux and _d dt_

is

the total derivative with respect to time. Equation (5.1) means that the electric field 

_E_ is induced along a closed loop by the changing magnetic flux ΦB in the region encircled by the loop.




  

From symmetry considerations, James Clerk Maxwell showed that the change in electric field also produces a magnetic field which is given by

_B dl d dt_

_d dt_

_E dA l_

_E S_

\= − −=∫ ∫Φ. . (5.2)

Magnetic field induced along a closed loop

Variation of electric flux with time

Changing electric flux ΦE in the region enclosed by the loop

where ΦE is the electric flux. This is known as **Maxwell’s law of induction** which explains that the magnetic field



_B_ is induced along a closed loop by the changing electric flux ΦE in the region encircled by that loop. This symmetry between electric and magnetic fields explains the existence of electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, gamma rays, infrared rays etc.

**Displacement current − Maxwell’s correction**

In order to understand how the changing electric field induces magnetic field, let us consider a situation of charging a parallel plate capacitor which contains non−conducting medium between the plates.

Let a time−dependent current _ic_, called conduction current be passed through the wire to charge the capacitor.

Ampere’s circuital law can be used to find the magnetic field produced around the current carrying wire.

To calculate the magnetic field at a point _P_ near the wire and outside the capacitor, let us draw a circular Amperian loop which encloses the circular surface _S1_ (Figure 5.3). Using Ampere’s circuital law for this loop, we get

where µo is the permeability of free space.

Now, the same loop is enclosed by balloon shaped surface _S2_ such that boundaries of two surfaces _S1_ and _S2_ are same but the shape of the surfaces is different (Figure 5.4). As Ampere’s law applied for a given closed loop does not depend on the shape of the enclosing surface, the integrals should give the same answer. But by applying Ampere’s circuital law for the surface _S2_, we get

   _B dl_⋅ =∫ 0

enclosing S2

(5.4)

The right hand side of equation is zero because the surface _S2_ nowhere touches the wire carrying conduction current and further, there is no current flowing between




  

the plates of the capacitor (gap between the plates). So the magnetic field at a point _P_ is zero. Hence there is an inconsistency between equations (5.3) and (5.4).

Maxwell resolved this inconsistency as follows: While the capacitor is being charged up, varying electric field is produced between capacitor plates. There must be a current associated with the changing electric field between capacitor plates. In other words, time−varying electric field (or time−varying electric flux) produces a current. This is known as displacement current flowing between the plates of the capacitor (Figure 5.5).

The **displacement current can be defined as the current which comes into play in the region in which the electric field (or the electric flux) is changing with time**. In other words, whenever the change in electric field takes place, displacement current is produced.

where the total current enclosed by the surface becomes the sum of conduction current and displacement current. Therefore, = +_c di i i_ . The equation (5.6) is known as **Ampere− Maxwell law**. When the current in the circuit is constant, the displacement current is zero.

Between the plates, the conduction current is zero while the displacement current is non−zero. This displacement current or time−varying electric field can also produce a magnetic field between the plates of the capacitor. The magnetic field at a point inside the capacitor is perpendicular to the electric field and is shown in Figure 5.6. This magnetic field can be determined using equation (5.6).

**Importance of Maxwell’s correction:** Earth receives radiations from Sun and

other stars. These radiations travel through empty space where there are no electric charges and hence no electric current. Ampere’s law says that only electric current can produce a magnetic field. If Ampere’s law alone is true, there will not be any radiation.

In stars, due to thermal excitation of atoms, time−varying electric field is produced which in turn, produces time− varying magnetic field. According to Faraday’s law, this time−varying magnetic field produces again time−varying electric field and so on. The coupled time−varying electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space with the speed of light and is called electromagnetic wave.

Even though Maxwell initially started with purely symmetry argument, his correction term explains one of the important aspects of the universe, namely the existence of electromagnetic waves.

**Displacement current** The name stuck because Maxwell named it. The word

displacement is poorly chosen because nothing is being displaced here.

**Note**  

**EXAMPLE 5.1**

Consider a parallel plate capacitor which is connected to an 230 V RMS value and 50 Hz frequency. If the separation distance between the plates of the capacitor and area of the plates are 1 mm and 20 cm2

### Maxwell’s equations in integral form

Electrodynamics can be summarized in four basic equations, known as Maxwell’s equations. These equations are analogous to Newton’s equations in mechanics. Maxwell’s equations completely explain the behaviour of charges, currents and properties of electric and magnetic fields. These equations can be written in integral form (or integration form) or derivative form (or differential form). The

differential form of Maxwell’s equation is beyond higher secondary level. So we focus only the integral form of Maxwell’s equations.

**First equation** It is nothing but the Gauss’s law of

electricity. It relates the net electric flux to net electric charge enclosed in a surface. Mathematically, it is expressed as

 

  _E dA_

_Qenclosed_

_s_

⋅ =∫ e

(Gauss’s law for electricity)

(5.7)

where 

_E_ is the electric field and Q enclosed is the net charge enclosed by the surface S. This equation is true for both discrete and continuous distribution of charges.

It also indicates that the electric field lines start from positive charge and terminate at negative charge. This implies that the electric field lines do not form a continuous closed path. In other words, it means that an isolated positive charge or negative charge can exist.

**Second equation** This law is similar to Gauss’s law for

electricity. So this law can also be called as Gauss’s law for magnetism. The surface integral of magnetic field over a closed surface is zero. Mathematically,

(Gauss’s law for magnetism) (5.8)

where 

_B_ is the magnetic field. This equation implies that the magnetic

lines of force form a continuous closed path. In other words, it means that no isolated magnetic monopole exists.  

**Third equation** It is Faraday’s law of electromagnetic

induction. This law relates electric field with the changing magnetic flux which is mathematically written as

   _E dl d_

_B_⋅ =−∫ Φ (Faraday’s law) (5.9)

where 

_E_ is the electric field. This equation implies that the line integral of the electric field around any closed path is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the closed path bounded by the surface.

Our modern technological revolution is due to Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction.

**Fourth equation** It is modified Ampere’s circuital law.

This is also known as Ampere – Maxwell law. This law relates the magnetic field around any closed path to the conduction current and displacement current through that path.

These four equations are known as Maxwell’s equations in electrodynamics. This equation ensures the existence of electromagnetic waves. The entire communication system in the world depends on electromagnetic waves. In fact our understanding of stars, galaxy, planets etc come by analysing the electromagnetic waves emitted by these astronomical objects.




  

## ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

**Electromagnetic waves are non- mechanical waves which move with speed equals to the speed of light (in vacuum).** It is a transverse wave. In the following subsections, we discuss the production of electromagnetic waves and its properties, sources of electromagnetic waves and also classification of electromagnetic spectrum.

### Production and properties of electromagnetic waves

**Production of electromagnetic waves - Hertz experiment**

Maxwell’s prediction was experimentally confirmed by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in 1888. The experimental set up used is shown in Figure 5.7 (b).

It consists of two metal electrodes which are made of small spherical metals. These are connected to larger spheres and the ends of them are connected to induction coil with very large number of turns. This is to produce very high electromotive force (emf).

![(a) Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (b) S](5.7.png "")

(a) (b)  

Since the coil is maintained at very high potential, air between the electrodes gets ionized and spark (spark means discharge of electricity) is produced. This discharge of electricity affects another electrode (ring type — not completely closed) which is kept at far distance. This implies that the energy is transmitted from electrode to the receiver (ring electrode) in the form of waves, known as electromagnetic waves.

If the receiver is rotated by 90°, then no spark is observed by the receiver. This confirms that electromagnetic waves are transverse waves as predicted by Maxwell. Hertz detected radio waves and also computed the speed of radio waves which is equal to the speed of light (3 × 108 m s–1).

**Properties of electromagnetic waves** 1\. Electromagnetic waves are produced

by any accelerated charge. 2. Electromagnetic waves do not

require any medium for propagation. So electromagnetic wave is a non-mechanical wave.

3\. Electromagnetic waves are transverse in nature. The oscillating electric field

### Sources of electromagnetic waves

Any stationary charge produces only electric field (refer Unit 1). When the charge moves with uniform velocity, it produces steady current which gives rise to magnetic field (not time dependent, only space dependent) around the conductor in which charge flows. If the charged

particle accelerates, it produces magnetic field in addition to electric field. Both electric and magnetic fields are time varying fields. Since the electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, the direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves is perpendicular to the planes containing electric and magnetic field vectors.

Any oscillatory motion is also an accelerated motion. So, when the charge oscillates (oscillating molecular dipole) about their mean position (Figure 5.9), it produces electromagnetic waves.

Suppose the electromagnetic field in free space propagates along _z_\-direction and if the electric field vector points along _x_\-axis, then the magnetic field vector will be mutually perpendicular to both electric field and the direction of wave propagation. Thus

Note that both electric field and magnetic field oscillate with a frequency (frequency of electromagnetic wave) which is equal to the frequency of the source (here, oscillating charge is the source for the production of electromagnetic waves). In free space or in vacuum, the ratio between _Eo_ and _Bo_ is equal to the speed of electromagnetic wave and is equal to speed of light _c_.

This magnetic field can be easily produced with a permanent magnet. So, electromagnetic waves of frequency 2450 MHz can be used for heating and cooking food because they are strongly absorbed by water molecules.

## TYPES OF SPECTRUM- EMISSION AND ABSORPTION SPECTRUM- FRAUNHOFER LINES

When an object burns, it emits radiations. That is, it emits electromagnetic radiation which depends on temperature. If the object becomes hot, it glows in red colour. If the temperature of the object is further increased, then it glows in reddish- orange colour and becomes white when it is hottest. The spectrum in Figure 5.11 usually

is called black body spectrum (Refer XI Physics Unit 8). It is a continuous frequency (or wavelength) curve depending on the body’s temperature.

Suppose we allow a beam of white light to pass through the prism (as shown in Figure 5.12). It is split into its seven constituent colours which can be viewed on the screen as continuous spectrum. This phenomenon is known as dispersion of light and the definite pattern of colours obtained on the screen after dispersion is called as spectrum. The spectra can be broadly classified into two catagories:

![White light passed through prism – dispersion](5.12.png "")

**(a)Emission spectra** When the spectrum of self luminous

source is taken, we get emission spectrum. Each source has its own characteristic

![continuous emission spectra](5.13.png "")

emission spectrum. The emission spectrum can be divided into three types:

**(i) Continuous emission spectrum (or continuous spectrum)** If the light from incandescent lamp

(filament bulb) is allowed to pass through prism (simplest spectroscope), it splits up into seven colours. Thus, it consists of wavelengths containing all the visible colours ranging from violet to red (Figure 5.13). Examples: spectrum obtained from carbon arc and incandescent solids.

**(ii) Line emission spectrum (or line spectrum):**

Suppose light from hot gas is allowed to pass through prism, line spectrum is observed (Figure 5.14). Line spectra are also known as discontinuous spectra. The line spectra consists of sharp lines of definite wavelengths or frequencies. Such spectra arise due to excited atoms of elements. These lines are the characteristics of the element and are different for different elements. Examples: spectra of atomic hydrogen, helium, etc.

**(iii) Band emission spectrum (or band spectrum)**

Band spectrum consists of several number of very closely spaced spectral lines which overlap together forming specific

**Continuous spectrum**

**Line spectrum**




  

**Fraunhofer lines** When the spectrum obtained from the

Sun is examined, it consists of large number of dark lines (line absorption spectrum). These dark lines in the solar spectrum are

bands which are separated by dark spaces. This spectrum has a sharp edge at one end and fades out at the other end. Such spectra arise when the molecules are excited. Band spectrum is the characteristic of the molecule and hence the structure of the molecules can be studied using their band spectra. Example: spectra of ammonia gas in the discharge tube etc.

**(b) Absorption spectra When light is allowed to pass through**

**a medium or an absorbing substance then the spectrum obtained is known as absorption spectrum.** It is the characteristic of absorbing substance. Absorption spectrum is classified into three types:

**(i) Continuous absorption spectrum**

When we pass white light through a blue glass plate, it absorbs all the colours except blue and gives continuous absorption spectrum.

known as Fraunhofer lines (Figure 5.16). The absorption spectra for various materials are compared with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum, which helps in identifying elements present in the Sun’s atmosphere.

**Absorption spectrum**

**(ii) Line absorption spectrum**

When light from the incandescent lamp is passed through cold gas (medium), the spectrum obtained through the dispersion due to prism is line absorption spectrum (Figure 5.15). Similarly, if the light from the carbon arc is made to pass through sodium vapour, a continuous spectrum of carbon arc with two dark lines in the yellow region are obtained.

**(iii) Band absorption spectrum**

When white light is passed through the iodine vapour, dark bands on continuous bright background is obtained. This type of band is also obtained when white light is passed through diluted solution of blood or chlorophyll or through certain solutions of organic and inorganic compounds.
