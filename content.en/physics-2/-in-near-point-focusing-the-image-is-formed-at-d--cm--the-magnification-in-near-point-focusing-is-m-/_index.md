**INTRODUCTION**

We are familiar with the concepts of particle and wave in our everyday experience. Marble balls, grains of sand, atoms, electrons and so on are some examples of particles while the examples of waves are sea waves, ripples in a pond, sound waves and light waves.

Particle is a material object which is considered as a tiny concentration of matter (localized in space and time) whereas wave is a broad distribution of energy (not localized in space and time). They, both particles and waves, have the ability to carry energy and momentum from one place to another.

DUAL N  

_ked you, you have not understood it yet”_ – Neils Bohr

Classical physics which describes the motion of the macroscopic objects treats particles and waves as separate components of physical reality. The mechanics of particles and the optics of waves are traditionally independent subjects, each with its own experiments and principles.

Electromagnetic radiations are regarded as waves because they exhibit wave nature in phenomena such as interference, diffraction and polarization under some suitable circumstances. Similarly, under other circumstances like black body radiation and photo electric effect, electromagnetic radiations behave as though they consist of stream of particles.

When electrons, protons and other particles are discovered, they are considered as particles because they possess mass and

charge. However, later experiments showed that under certain circumstances, they exhibit wave-like properties also.

In this unit, the particle nature of waves (radiation) and the wave nature of particles (matter) – that is, wave-particle duality of radiation and matter is discussed with the relevant experimental observations supporting this dual nature.

**8.1.1 Electron emission**

In metals, the electrons in the outer most shells are loosely bound to the nucleus. Even at room temperature, there are a large number of free electrons which are moving inside the metal in a random manner. Though they move freely inside the metal, they cannot leave the surface of the metal. The reason is that when free electrons reach the surface of the metal, they are attracted by the positive nuclei of the metal. It is this attractive pull which will not allow free electrons to leave the metallic surface at room temperature.

In order to leave the metallic surface, the free electrons must cross a potential barrier created by the positive nuclei of the metal. **The potential barrier which prevents free electrons from leaving the metallic surface is called surface barrier**.

Free electrons possess some kinetic energy and this energy is different for different electrons. The kinetic energy of the free electrons is not sufficient to overcome the surface barrier. Whenever an additional energy is given to the free electrons, they will have sufficient energy to cross the surface barrier and they escape from the metallic surface**. The liberation of electrons from any surface of a substance is called** **electron emission**.  

**The minimum energy needed for an electron to escape from the metal surface is called work function of that metal**. The work function of the metal is denoted by φ0 and is measured in electron volt (eV).

The SI unit of energy is joule. But electron volt is a commonly used unit of

energy in atomic and nuclear physics.

One electron volt is defined as the kinetic energy gained by an electron when accelerated by a potential difference of 1 V.

1 _eV_ = KE gained by the electron

\= Work done by the electric field

\= q V

\= 1.602 × 10–19 C × 1 V

\= 1.602 × 10–19 J

**Note**

Suppose the maximum kinetic energy of the free electron inside the metal is 0.5 eV and the energy needed to overcome the surface barrier of a metal is 3 eV, then the minimum energy needed for electron emission from the metallic surface is 3 – 0.5 = 2.5 eV. Here 2.5 eV is the work function of the metal.

The work function is different for different metals and is a typical property of metals and the nature of their surface. Table 8.1 gives the approximate value of work function for various metals. The material with smaller work function is more effective in electron emission because extra energy required to release the free electrons from the metal surface is smaller.
  

So the metal selected for electron emission should have low work function. The electron emission is categorized into different types depending upon the form of energy being utilized. There are mainly four types of electron emission which are given below.

**i) Thermionic emission** When a metal is heated to a high

temperature, the free electrons on the surface of the metal get sufficient energy in the form of thermal energy so that they are emitted from the metallic surface (Figure 8.1). This type of emission is known as **thermionic emission**.

**Metal Electrons liberated**

**ermal energy** (b)**Electrons**(a)

**Figure 8.1** Electrons in the (a) metal (b) heated metal

The intensity of the thermionic emission (the number of electrons emitted) depends on the metal used and its temperature. **Examples:** cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, x-ray tubes etc (Figure 8.2).

**ii) Field emission** Electric field emission occurs when a

very strong electric field is applied across the metal. This strong field pulls the free electrons and helps them to overcome the surface barrier of the metal (Figure 8.3). **Examples:** Field emission scanning electron microscopes, Field-emission display etc.

**iii) Photo electric emission** When an electromagnetic radiation of

suitable frequency is incident on the surface of the metal, the energy is transferred from the radiation to the free electrons. Hence, the free electrons get sufficient energy to cross the surface barrier and the photo electric emission takes place (Figure 8.4). The number of electrons emitted depends on the intensity of the incident radiation. **Examples:** Photo diodes, photo electric cells etc.

**Free electrons**

**Radiation Emitted electrons**

**Metal**

**Figure 8.4** Photo electric emission

**iv) Secondary emission** When a beam of fast moving electrons

strikes the surface of the metal, the kinetic energy of the striking electrons is transferred to the free electrons on the metal surface. Thus the free electrons get sufficient kinetic energy so that the secondary emission of electron occurs (Figure 8.5). **Examples:** Image intensifiers, photo multiplier tubes etc.

**PHOTO ELECTRIC EFFECT**

**8.2.1 Hertz, Hallwachs and Lenard’s observation**

**Hertz observation** Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism

predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves and concluded that light itself is just an electromagnetic wave. Then the experimentalists tried to generate and detect electromagnetic waves through various experiments.

In 1887, Heinrich Hertz was successful in generating and detecting electromagnetic wave with his high voltage induction coil causing a spark discharge between two metallic spheres (we have learnt this in Unit 5 of XII standard physics). When a spark is formed, the charges will oscillate back and forth rapidly and the electromagnetic waves are produced.

The electromagnetic waves thus produced were detected by a detector that has a copper wire bent in the shape of a circle. Although the detection of waves is successful, there is a problem in observing the tiny spark produced in the detector.

In order to improve the visibility of the spark, Hertz made many attempts and finally noticed an important thing that small detector spark became more vigorous when it was exposed to ultraviolet light.

The reason for this behaviour of the spark was not known at that time. Later it was found that it is due to the photoelectric emission. Whenever ultraviolet light is incident on the metallic sphere, the electrons on the outer surface are emitted which caused the spark to be more vigorous.

  

It is interesting to note that the experiment of Hertz confirmed that light is an

electromagnetic wave. But the same experiment also produced the first evidence for particle nature of light.

**Hallwachs’ observation** In 1888, Wilhelm Hallwachs, a German

physicist, confirmed that the strange behaviour of the spark is due to the action of ultraviolet light with his simple experiment.

A clean circular plate of zinc is mounted on an insulating stand and is attached to a gold leaf electroscope by a wire. When the uncharged zinc plate is irradiated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp, it becomes positively charged and the leaves will open as shown in Figure 8.6(a).

Further, if the negatively charged zinc plate is exposed to ultraviolet light, the leaves will come closer as the charges leaked away quickly (Figure 8.6(b)). If the plate is positively charged, it becomes more positive upon UV rays irradiation and the leaves open further (Figure 8.6(c)). From these observations, it was concluded that negatively charged electrons were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of ultraviolet light.

**Lenard’s observation** In 1902, Lenard studied this electron

emission phenomenon in detail. His simple experimental setup is shown in Figure 8.7. The apparatus consists of two metallic plates _A_ and _C_ placed in an evacuated quartz bulb. The galvanometer _G_ and battery _B_ are connected in the circuit.

**Figure 8.7** Experimental setup of Lenard

When ultraviolet light is incident on the negative plate _C_, an electric current flows in the circuit that is indicated by the deflection in the galvanometer. On other hand, if the positive plate is irradiated by the ultraviolet light, no current is observed in the circuit.

From these observations, it is concluded that when ultraviolet light falls on the negative plate, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted by the positive plate _A_. On reaching the positive plate through the evacuated bulb, the circuit is completed and the current flows in it. Thus, the ultraviolet light falling on the negative plate causes the electron emission from the surface of the plate.

**Photoelectric effect** The ejection of electrons from a

metal plate when illuminated by light or any other electromagnetic radiation

of suitable wavelength (or frequency) is called **photoelectric effect**. Although these electrons are not different from all other electrons, it is customary to call them as **photoelectrons** and the corresponding current as **photoelectric current or photo current**.

Metals like cadmium, zinc, magnesium etc show photoelectric emission with ultraviolet light while some alkali metals lithium, sodium, caesium respond well even to larger wavelength radiation like visible light. The materials which eject photoelectrons upon irradiation of electromagnetic wave of suitable wavelength are called **photosensitive materials**.

**8.2.2 Effect of intensity of incident light on photoelectric current**

employed to study the phenomenon of photoelectric effect in detail. _S_ is a source of electromagnetic waves of known and variable frequency _ν_ and intensity _I_. _C_ is

the cathode (negative electrode) made up of photosensitive material and is used to emit electrons. The anode (positive electrode) _A_ collects the electrons emitted from _C_. These electrodes are kept in an evacuated glass envelope with a quartz window that permits the passage of ultraviolet and visible light.

The necessary potential difference between _C_ and _A_ is provided by high tension battery _B_ which is connected across a potential divider arrangement _PQ_ through a key _K_. _C_ is connected to the centre terminal while _A_ to the sliding contact _J_ of the potential divider. The plate _A_ can be maintained at a desired positive or negative potential with respect to _C_. To measure both positive and negative potential of _A_ with respect to _C_, the voltmeter is designed to have its zero marking at the centre and is connected between _A_ and _C_. The current is measured by a micro ammeter _mA_ connected in series.

If there is no light falling on the cathode _C_, no photoelectrons are emitted and the microammeter reads zero. When ultraviolet or visible light is allowed to fall on _C_, the photoelectrons are liberated and are attracted towards anode. As a result, the

photoelectric current is set up in the circuit which is measured using micro ammeter.

The variation of photocurrent with respect to (i) intensity of incident light (ii) the potential difference between the electrodes (iii) the nature of the material and (iv) frequency of incident light can be studied with the help of this arrangement.

**Effect of intensity of incident light on photoelectric current**

To study the effect of intensity of incident light on photoelectric current, the frequency of the incident light and the accelerating potential _V_ of the anode are kept constant. Here the potential of _A_ is kept positive with respect to that of _C_ so that the electrons emitted from _C_ are attracted towards _A_. Now, the intensity of the incident light is varied and the corresponding photoelectric current is measured.

**Figure 8.9** Variation of photocurrent with intensity

A graph is drawn between light intensity along x-axis and the photocurrent along y-axis. From the graph in Figure 8.9, it is evident that _photocurrent – the number of electrons emitted per second – is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light_.  

Here, intensity of light means brightness. A bright light has more intensity than a dim light.

**Note**

**8.2.3 Effect of potential difference on photoelectric current**

To study the effect of potential difference _V_ between the electrodes on photoelectric current, the frequency and intensity of the incident light are kept constant. Initially the potential of _A_ is kept positive with respect to _C_ and the cathode is irradiated with the given light.

Now, the potential of _A_ is increased and the corresponding photocurrent is noted. As the potential of _A_ is increased, photocurrent also increases. However a stage is reached where photocurrent reaches a saturation value (saturation current) at which all the photoelectrons from _C_ are collected by _A_. This is represented by the flat portion of the graph between potential of _A_ and photocurrent (Figure 8.10).

When a negative (retarding) potential is applied to _A_ with respect to _C_, the current does not immediately drop to zero because the photoelectrons are emitted with some definite and different kinetic energies. The kinetic energy of some of the photoelectrons is such that they could overcome the retarding electric field and reach the electrode _A_.

When the negative (retarding) potential of _A_ is gradually increased, the photocurrent starts to decrease because more and more photoelectrons are being repelled away from reaching the electrode _A_. The photocurrent becomes zero at a

**Stopping potential** is that value of the negative (retarding) potential given to the collecting electrode _A_ which is just sufficient to stop the most energetic photoelectrons emitted and make the photocurrent zero.

At the stopping potential, even the most energetic electron is brought to rest. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy of the fastest electron (_K_max) is equal to the work done by the stopping potential to stop it (_eV_0).

From equation (8.1),

From the Figure 8.10, when the intensity of the incident light alone is increased, the saturation current also increases but the value of _V_0 remains constant.

Thus, for a given frequency of the incident light, the stopping potential is independent of intensity of the incident light. This also implies that _the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is independent of intensity of the incident light_.

**8.2.4 Effect of frequency of incident light on stopping potential**

To study the effect of frequency of incident light on stopping potential, the intensity of the incident light is kept constant. The variation of photocurrent with the collecting electrode potential is studied for radiations of different frequencies and a graph drawn between them is shown in Figure 8.11. From the graph, it is clear that stopping potential vary over different frequencies of incident light.

Greater the frequency of the incident radiation, larger is the corresponding stopping potential. This implies that _as the frequency is increased, the photoelectrons are emitted with greater kinetic energies so that the retarding potential needed to stop the photoelectrons is also greater_.

Now a graph is drawn between frequency of incident radiation and the stopping potential for different metals (Figure 8.12). From this graph, it is found that stopping potential varies linearly with frequency. Below a certain frequency called threshold frequency, no electrons are emitted; hence stopping potential is zero for that reason. But as the frequency is increased above threshold value, the stopping potential varies linearly with the frequency of incident light.

**8.2.5 Laws of photoelectric effect**

The above detailed experimental investigations of photoelectric effect revealed the following results: i) For a given metallic surface, the emission

of photoelectrons takes place only if the frequency of incident light is greater  

than a certain minimum frequency called the threshold frequency.

ii) For a given frequency of incident light (above threshold value), the number of photoelectrons emitted is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. The saturation current is also directly proportional to the intensity of incident light.

iii) Maximum kinetic energy of the photo electrons is independent of intensity of the incident light.

iv) Maximum kinetic energy of the photo electrons from a given metal is directly proportional to the frequency of incident light.

v) There is no time lag between incidence of light and ejection of photoelectrons.

Once photoelectric phenomenon has been thoroughly examined through various experiments, the attempts were made to explain it on the basis of wave theory of light.

**8.2.6 Concept of quantization of energy**

**Failures of classical wave theory** From Maxwell’s theory (Refer unit 5

of volume 1), we learnt that light is an electromagnetic wave consisting of coupled electric and magnetic oscillations that move with the speed of light and exhibit typical wave behaviour. Let us try to explain the experimental observations of photoelectric effect using wave picture of light.

**i)** When light is incident on a metallic surface, there is a continuous supply of energy to the electrons in the metal surface. According to wave theory, light of greater intensity should impart greater kinetic energy to the liberated electrons (Here, Intensity of light is the energy delivered per unit area per unit time).
  

But this does not happen. The experiments show that maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted does not depend on the intensity of the incident light.

**ii)** According to wave theory, if a sufficiently intense beam of light is incident on the surface, electrons should be liberated from the surface of the target, however low the frequency of the radiation is.

From the experiments, it is found that photoelectric emission is not possible below a certain minimum frequency of incident radition. Therefore, the wave theory fails to explain the existence of threshold frequency.

**iii)** Since the energy of light is spread across the entire wavefront, the electrons which receive energy from it are large in number. Each electron needs considerable amount of time (a few hours) to get energy sufficient to overcome the work function and to get liberated from the surface.

But experiments show that photoelectric emission is almost instantaneous process (the time lag is less than 10–9 _s_ after the surface is illuminated) which could not be explained by wave theory.

Thus, the experimental observations of photoelectric emission could not be explained on the basis of the wave theory of light.

**EXAMPLE 8.1**

For the photoelectric emission from cesium, show that wave theory predicts that

**i)** maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons (_K_max) depends on the intensity _I_ of the incident light

**ii)** _K_max does not depend on the frequency of the incident light and

**iii)** the time interval between the incidence of light and the ejection of photoelectrons is very long.  

For the sake of simplicity, the following standard assumptions can be made when light is incident on the given material.

a) Light is absorbed in the top atomic layer of the metal

b) For a given element, each atom absorbs an equal amount of energy and this energy is proportional to its cross-sectional area _A_

c) Each atom gives this energy to one of the electrons.

(Given : The work function for cesium is 2.14 eV and the power absorbed per unit area is 1 60 10 6 2. × − −Wm which produces a measurable photocurrent in cesium.)

**_Solution_**

**i)** According to wave theory, the energy in a light wave is spread out uniformly and continuously over the wavefront.

The energy absorbed by each electron in time _t_ is given by

_E = IAt_

With this energy absorbed, the most energetic electron is released with _K_max by overcoming the surface energy barrier or work function _ϕ_0 and this is expressed as

_K IAt_max = − _ϕ_0 (1)

Thus, wave theory predicts that for a unit time, at low light intensities when _IA < ϕ_0, no electrons are emitted. At higher intensities, when _IA ≥ ϕ_0, electrons are emitted. This implies that higher the light intensity, greater will be _K_max_._

_K_max is dependent only on the intensity under given conditions – that is, by suitably increasing the intensity, one can produce
  

photoelectric effect even if the frequency is less than the threshold frequency. So the concept of threshold frequency does not even exist in wave theory.

**ii)** According to wave theory, the intensity of a light wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the electric field ( )._E_0

2 The amplitude of this electric field increases with increasing intensity and imparts an increasing acceleration and kinetic energy to an electron.

Now _I_ is replaced with a quantity proportional to _E_0

2 in equation (1). This means that _K_max should not depend at all on the frequency of the classical light wave which again contradicts the experimental results.

**iii)** If an electron accumulates light energy just enough to overcome the work function, then it is ejected out of the atom with zero kinetic energy. Therefore, from equation (1),

0 0= −_IAt ϕ_

\= = _ϕ ϕ_

By taking the atomic radius _r_ \= × −1 0 10 10. m and substituting the given values of _I_ and _ϕ_0, we can estimate the time interval as

**Concept of quantization of energy** Max Planck proposed quantum concept

in 1900 in order to explain the thermal  

radiations emitted by a black body and the shape of its radiation curves.

According to Planck, matter is composed of a large number of oscillating particles (atoms) which vibrate with different frequencies. Each atomic oscillator - which vibrates with its characteristic frequency - emits or absorbs electromagnetic radiation of the same frequency. It also says that i) If an oscillator vibrates with frequency _v_,

its energy can have only certain discrete values, given by the equation.

_E_n= _nhν_ _n=_1,2,3.... (8.5)

where _h_ is a constant, called Planck’s constant.

ii) The oscillators emit or absorb energy in small packets or quanta and the energy of each quantum is _hν_.

This implies that the energy of the oscillator is quantized – that is, energy is not continuous as believed in the wave picture. This is called **quantization of energy**.

**8.2.7 Particle nature of light: Einstein’s explanation**

Einstein extended Planck’s quantum concept to explain the photoelectric effect in 1905. According to Einstein, the energy in light is not spread out over wavefronts but is concentrated in small packets or energy quanta. Therefore, light (or any other electromagnetic waves) of frequency _v_ from any source can be considered as a stream of quanta and the energy of each light quantum is given by _E_ = _hν_.

He also proposed that a quantum of light has linear momentum and the magnitude

of that linear momentum is _h c ν_ ._p =_ . The

individual light quantum of definite energy and momentum can be associated with a

particle. The light quantum can behave as a particle and this is called photon. Therefore, photon is nothing but particle manifestation of light.

**Characteristics of photons:** According to particle nature of light,

photons are the basic constituents of any radiation and possess the following characteristic properties:

i) The photons of light of frequency _ν_ and wavelength λ will have energy, given by

_E hv hc_\= = _l_

.

ii) The energy of a photon is determined by the frequency of the radiation and not by its intensity and the intensity has no relation with the energy of the individual photons in the beam.

iii) The photons travel with the speed of light and its momentum is given by

_p h hv c_

\= = _l_

iv) Since photons are electrically neutral, they are unaffected by electric and magnetic fields.

v) When a photon interacts with matter (photon-electron collision), the total energy, total linear momentum and angular momentum are conserved. Since photon may be absorbed or a new photon may be produced in such interactions, the number of photons may not be conserved.

According to quantum concept, intensity of light of given wavelength is defined

as the number of energy quanta or photons incident per unit area per unit time, with each photon having same energy. Its unit is Wm–2.

**Note**  

**Einstein’s explanation of photoelectric equation**

When a photon of energy _hν_ is incident on a metal surface, it is completely absorbed by a single electron and the electron is ejected. In this process, a part of the photon energy is used in overcoming the potential barrier of the metal surface (photoelectric work function _ϕ_0 )and the remaining energy as the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. From the law of conservation of energy,

_h mv ϕ v_0 21

2 = + (8.6)

where _m_ is the mass of the electron and _v_ its velocity. This is shown in Figure 8.13(a).

**_K = 0_**

**Metal Metal**

**_E = hv_0**

**(a) (b)**

**_E = hv_**

**_Kmax = hv – hv_0**

**Figure 8.13** Emission of photoelectrons

If we reduce the frequency of the incident light, the speed or kinetic energy of photo electrons is also reduced. At some frequency _ν_0 of incident radiation, the photo electrons are just ejected with almost zero kinetic energy (Figure 8.13(b)). Then the equation (8.6) becomes

_hv_0 = _ϕ_0

where _ν_0 is the threshold frequency. By
  

rewriting the equation (8.6), we get

_hv hv m_0 1 2

\= + _v_2 (8.7)

The equation (8.7) is known as **Einstein’s photoelectric equation**.

If the electron does not lose energy by internal collisions, then it is emitted with maximum kinetic energy _K_max. Then

_K m_max max= 1 2

2_v_

where _v_max is the maximum velocity of the electron ejected. The equation (8.6) is rearranged as follows:

_Kmax_ = _hv_ – _ϕ_0 (8.8)

A graph between maximum kinetic energy _K_max of the photoelectron and frequency _ν_ of the incident light is a straight line as shown in Figure 8.14. The slope of the line is _h_ and its y-intercept is –_ϕ_0.

Einstein’s equation was experimentally verified by R.A. Millikan. He drew _K_max versus _ν_ graph for many metals (cesium, potassium, sodium and lithium) as shown in Figure 8.15 and found that the slope is independent of the metals.

Millikan also calculated the value of Planck’s constant (_h_ \= 6.626 × 10–34 Js) and work function of many metals (Cs, K, Na, Ca); these values are in agreement with the theoretical prediction.

**Explanation for the photoelectric effect:** The experimentally observed facts of

photoelectric effect can be explained with the help of Einstein’s photoelectric equation.

**i)** As each incident photon liberates one electron, then the increase of intensity of the light (the number of photons per unit area per unit time) increases the number of electrons emitted thereby increasing the photocurrent. The same has been experimentally observed.

**ii)** From _Kmax_ \= _hv_ – _ϕ_0, it is evident that _K_max is proportional to the frequency of the incident light and is independent of intensity of the light.

**iii)** As given in equation (8.7), there must be minimum energy (equal to the work function of the metal) for incident photons to liberate electrons from the metal surface. Below this value of energy, emission of electrons is not possible. Correspondingly, there exists minimum frequency called threshold frequency below which there is no photoelectric emission.

**iv)** According to quantum concept, the transfer of photon energy to the electrons is instantaneous so that there is no time lag between incidence of photons and ejection of electrons.

Thus, the photoelectric effect is explained on the basis of quantum concept of light.

**The nature of light: wave - particle duality** We have learnt that wave nature of light

explains phenomena such as interference, diffraction and polarization. Certain phenomena like black body radiation, photoelectric effect can be explained by assigning particle nature to light. Therefore, both theories have enough experimental evidences.

In the past, many scientific theories have been either revised or discarded when they contradicted with new experimental results. Here, two different theories are needed to answer the question: what is nature of light?

It is therefore concluded that light possesses dual nature, that of both particle and wave. It behaves like a wave at some circumstances and it behaves like a particle at some other circumstances.

In other words, light behaves as a wave during its propagation and behaves as a particle during its interaction with matter. Both theories are necessary for complete description of physical phenomena. Hence, the wave nature and quantum nature complement each other.

A reader may find it difficult to u stream of particle. This is the case ev

Einstein once wrote a letter to his frustration:

“All these fifty years of conscious broodin question, ‘What are light quanta?’ Of course t but he is deluding himself ”.  

**8.2.8 Photo electric cells and their applications**

**Photo cell** Photo electric cell or photo cell is a device

which converts light energy into electrical energy. It works on the principle of photo electric effect. When light is incident on the photosensitive materials, their electric properties will get affected, based on which photo cells are classified into three types. They are i) **Photo emissive cell:** Its working

depends on the electron emission from a metal cathode due to irradiation of light or other radiations.

ii) **Photo voltaic cell:** Here sensitive element made of semiconductor is used which generates voltage proportional to the intensity of light or other radiations.

iii) **Photo conductive cell:** In this, the resistance of the semiconductor changes in accordance with the radiant energy incident on it.

In this section, we discuss about photo emissive cell and its applications.

**Photo emissive cell**

**Construction:** It consists of an evacuated glass

or quartz bulb in which two metallic electrodes – that is, a cathode and an anode are fixed as shown in Figure 8.16.

nderstand how light can be both a wave and a en for great scientist like Albert Einstein. his friend Michel Besso in 1954 expressing

g have brought me no closer to answer the oday everyone thinks he knows the answer,
  

The cathode _C_ is semi-cylindrical in shape and is coated with a photo sensitive material. The anode _A_ is a thin rod or wire kept along the axis of the semi-cylindrical cathode. A potential difference is applied between the anode and the cathode through a galvanometer _G_.

\_

\+ **G**

**B**

**AC**

**Radiation**

**Figure 8.16** Construction of photo cell

**Working:** When cathode is irradiated with suitable

radiation, electrons are emitted from it. These electrons are attracted by anode and hence a current is produced which is measured by the galvanometer. For a given cathode, the magnitude of the current depends on i) the intensity of incident radiation and ii) the potential difference between anode

and cathode.

**Applications of photo cells:** Photo cells have many applications,

especially as switches and sensors. Automatic lights that turn on when it gets dark use photocells, and street lights that switch on  

and switch off according to whether it is night or day use photocells.

Photo cells are used for reproduction of sound in motion pictures and are used as timers to measure the speeds of athletes during a race. Photo cells of exposure meters in photography are used to measure the intensity of the given light and to calculate the exact time of exposure.

**MATTER WAVES**

**8.3.1 Introduction - Wave nature of particles**

So far, we learnt that the characteristics of particles and waves are different. A wave is specified by its frequency, wavelength, wave velocity, amplitude and intensity. It spreads out and occupies a relatively large region of space. A particle specified by its mass, velocity, momentum and energy occupies a definite position in space and is very small in size.

Classical physics treated particles and waves as distinct entities. But quantum theory suggested dual character for radiations – that is, radiation behaves as a wave at times and as a particle at other times.

From this wave – particle duality of radiation, the concept of wave nature of matter arises which we will see in this section.

**De Broglie wave:** The wave–particle duality of radiation

was extended to matter by a French physicist Louis de Broglie (pronounced as de Broy) in 1924.

Greatly influenced by the symmetry in nature, de Broglie suggested that if radiation like light can act as particles at times, then material particles like electrons can also act as waves at times.

According to de Broglie hypothesis, all material particles like electrons, protons, neutrons in motion are associated with waves. These waves are called de Broglie waves or matter waves.  

**8.3.2 De Broglie wave length:**

The momentum of photon of frequency _ν_ is given by

_p hv c_

_h c v_\= = = λ

λ since

The wavelength of a photon in terms of its momentum is

λ = _h p_ (8.9)

According to de Broglie, the above equation is completely a general one and this is applicable to material particles as well. Therefore, for a particle of mass _m_ travelling with speed _v_ , the wavelength is given by

λ = = _h_

_m h pv_ (8.10)

This wavelength of the matter waves is known as **de Broglie wavelength**. This equation relates the wave character (the wave length λ) and the particle character (the momentum _p_) through Planck’s constant.

**8.3.3 De Broglie wave length of electrons:**

Let an electron of mass _m_ be accelerated through a potential difference of _V_ volt. The kinetic energy acquired by the electron is given by

2_m eVv_ \=

Therefore, the speed υ of the electron is

_v_ \= 2_eV m_

(8.11)

Hence, the de Broglie wavelength of the matter waves associated with electron is
  

λ = = _h_

For example, if an electron is accelerated through a potential difference of 100V, then its de Broglie wavelength is 1.227 Å.

Since the kinetic energy of the electron, _K_ = _eV_, then the de Broglie wavelength associated with electron can be also written as

λ = _h mK_2 (8.13)

**8.3.4 Davisson – Germer experiment**

Louis de Broglie hypothesis of matter waves was experimentally confirmed by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927. They demonstrated that electron beams are diffracted when they fall on crystalline solids. Since crystal can act as a three-dimensional diffraction grating for matter waves, the electron waves incident on crystals are diffracted off in certain specific directions. Figure 8.17 shows a schematic representation of the apparatus for the experiment.

The filament _F_ is heated by a low tension (L.T.) battery. Electrons are emitted from the hot filament by thermionic emission. They are then accelerated due to the potential difference between the filament and the anode aluminium cylinder by a high tension (H.T.) battery. Electron beam is collimated by using two thin aluminium diaphragms and is allowed to strike a single crystal of Nickel.

The electrons scattered by Ni atoms in different directions are received by the electron detector which measures the intensity of scattered electron beam. The detector is capable of rotation in the plane of the paper so that the angle _θ_ between the incident beam and the scattered beam can be changed at our will. The intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured as a function of the angle _θ_.

Figure 8.18 shows the variation of intensity of the scattered electrons with the angle _θ_ for the accelerating voltage of 54_V_. For a given accelerating voltage _V_, the

It is to be noted that electrons are not the only particles with which wave nature can be

demonstrated. The waves are associated with particles like neutrons and alpha particles also when they are in motion. They undergo diffraction when they are scattered by suitable crystals. Neutron diffraction studies are highly useful for investigating crystal structures.

**Note**

Diffraction is one of the properties of waves. Whenever waves are incident

on an obstacle, they bend around the edges of the obstacle. This bending of waves is called diffraction. The amount of bending depends on the wavelength of the waves. We have learnt in unit 7 that as the wavelength of light is very small, diffraction effects of light are very small. In order to study diffraction of light, diffraction gratings are used. Since x-rays and de Broglie waves of electrons have wavelengths (in the order of 10–10m) much shorter than that of the light wave, diffraction grating cannot be used in x-ray diffraction studies. In a crystal, the spacing between atomic planes is comparable to the wavelength of x-rays and de Broglie waves of electrons. Hence, in x-ray diffraction studies, the crystals are used which serve as three-dimensional grating.

**Note**  

scattered wave shows a peak or maximum at an angle of 50° to the incident electron beam. This peak in intensity is attributed to the constructive interference of electrons diffracted from various atomic layers of the target material. From the known value of interplanar spacing of Nickel, the wavelength of the electron wave was experimentally calculated as 1.65Å.

The wavelength can also be calculated from de Broglie relation for _V_ = 54 V from equation (8.12).

This value agrees very well with the experimentally observed wavelength of 1.65Å. Thus this experiment directly verifies de Broglie’s hypothesis of the wave nature of moving particles.

**8.3.5 Electron Microscope**

**Principle** This is the direct application of wave

nature of particles. The wave nature of the electron is used in the construction of microscope called **electron microscope**.

The resolving power of a microscope is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the radiation used for illuminating the object under study. Higher magnification as well as higher resolving power can be obtained by employing the waves of shorter wavelengths.

Louis de Broglie wavelength of electron is very much less than (a few thousands less) that of the visible light being used in optical microscopes. As a result, the microscopes employing de Broglie waves of electrons have very much higher resolving power than

optical microscope. Electron microscopes giving magnification more than 2,00,000 times are common in research laboratories.

**Working** The construction and working of an

electron microscope is similar to that of an optical microscope except that in electron microscope focussing of electron beam is done by the electrostatic or magnetic lenses. The electron beam passing across a suitably arranged either electric or magnetic fields undergoes divergence or convergence thereby focussing of the beam is done (Figure 8.19).

The electrons emitted from the source are accelerated by high potentials. The beam is made parallel by magnetic condenser lens. When the beam passes through the sample whose magnified image is needed, the beam carries the image of the sample.

With the help of magnetic objective lens and magnetic projector lens system, the

magnified image is obtained on the screen. These electron microscopes are being used in almost all branches of science.

From these calculations, we notice that electron has significant value of de Broglie wavelength (≈10–9m which can be measured from diffraction studies) but moving bullet and car have negligibly small de Broglie wavelengths associated with them (≈10–33m and 10–39m respectively, which are not measurable by any experiment). This implies that the wave nature of matter  

is important at the atomic level but it is not really relevant at the macroscopic level.

**X – RAYS**

**Introduction** Quantum theory of radiation explains

photoelectric effect in which the electrons are emitted due to the incidence of photons and the energy is transferred from photons to the electrons. Immediately, a question arises: Is the reverse process also possible?

This means that whether kinetic energy of electron can be transformed into photon energy or not. The phenomenon which  

answers this question has already been discovered, even before Planck’s quantum theory of radiation.

**Discovery of x-rays** Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895 discovered that

whenever fast moving electrons fall on certain materials, a highly penetrating radiation is emitted. Since their origin was not known at that time, they were called x-rays.

X-rays are electromagnetic waves of short wavelength ranging from 0.1 to 100_Å_. They travel along straight lines with the velocity of light and are not affected by electric and magnetic fields. X-ray photons are highly energetic because of its high frequency or short wavelength. Therefore, they can pass through materials which are opaque to visible light.

The quality of x-rays is measured in terms of their penetrating power which depends on the velocity with which the electrons strike the target material and the atomic number of target material. The intensity of x-rays is dependent on the number of electrons striking the target.

**Production of x-rays** X-rays are produced in x-ray tube which

is essentially a discharge tube as shown in Figure 8.20. A tungsten filament _F_ is heated to incandescence by a battery. As a result, electrons are emitted from it by thermionic emission.

The electrons are accelerated to high speeds by the voltage applied between the filament _F_ and the anode. The target materials like tungsten, molybdenum are embedded in the face of the solid copper anode. The face of the target is inclined at an angle of 45° with respect to the electron beam so that x-rays can leave the tube through its side.

**Figure 8.20** Production of x-rays

When high-speed electrons strike the target, they are decelerated suddenly and lose their kinetic energy. As a result, x-ray photons are produced. Since most of the kinetic energy of the bombarding electrons gets converted into heat, targets made of high-melting-point metals and a cooling system are usually employed.

**X-ray spectra** X-rays are produced when fast moving

electrons strike the metal target. The intensity of the x-rays when plotted against its wavelength gives a curve called **x-ray spectrum** (Figure 8.21(a) and (b)). X-ray spectra consist of two parts: a continuous spectrum and a series of peaks superimposed on it.

The **continuous spectrum** consists of radiations of all possible wavelengths with a certain minimum wavelength λ0 which depends on the voltage across the electrodes. The peaks are characteristics of the material of the target and hence it is called **characteristic spectrum**. Figure 8.21(a) depicts the x-ray spectra of tungsten at various accelerating voltages and Figure 8.21(b) shows the x-ray spectra of tungsten and molybdenum at a particular accelerating voltage.

**Figure 8.21** (b) X-ray spectra of tungsten and molybdenum at 35 _kV_ accelerating potential

Though classical electromagnetic theory suggests the emission of radiations from accelerating electrons, it could not explain two features exhibited by x-ray spectra. These features are given below. (i) For a given accelerating voltage, the

lower limit for the wavelength of continuous x-ray spectra is same for all targets. This minimum wavelength is called cut-off wavelength.

(ii) The intensity of x-rays is significantly increased at certain well-defined wavelengths as shown in the case of characteristic x-ray spectra for molybdenum (Figure 8.21(b)).
  

But these two features could be explained on the basis of photon theory of radiation. **Continuous x-ray spectra**

When a fast moving electron penetrates and approaches a target nucleus, the interaction between the electron and the nucleus either accelerates or decelerates it which results in a change of path of the electron. The radiation produced from such decelerating electron is called **Bremsstrahlung or braking radiation** (Figure 8.22).

**+**

**Electron of KE _E_1**

**Electron of KE _E_2**

**Photon of energy hν=_E_1–_E_2**

**_E_1>_E_2**

**Figure 8.22** Bremsstrahlung photon from a decelerating electron

The energy of the photon emitted is equal to the loss of kinetic energy of the electron. Since an electron may lose part or all of its energy to the photon, the photons are emitted with all possible energies (or frequencies). The continuous x-ray spectrum is due to such radiations.

When an electron gives up all its energy, then the photon is emitted with highest frequency _ν_0 (or lowest wavelength λ0 ). The initial kinetic energy of an electron is given by _eV_ where _V_ is the accelerating voltage. Therefore, we have

_hv eV_0 = (or) _hc eV_ λ0

\=

λ0 = _hc eV_  

where λ0 is the cut-off wavelength. Substituting the known values in the above equation, we get

λ 0

12400 =

_V_ Å (8.14)

The relation given by equation (8.14) is known as the **Duane – Hunt formula**.

The value of λ0 depends only on the accelerating potential and is same for all targets. This is in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the production of continuous x-ray spectrum and the origin of cut – off wavelength can be explained on the basis of photon theory of radiation.

**Characteristic x – ray spectra:** X – ray spectra show some narrow peaks

at some well – defined wavelengths when the target is hit by fast electrons. The line spectrum showing these peaks is called **characteristic x – ray** **spectrum**. This x – ray spectrum is due to the electronic transitions within the atoms.

When an energetic electron penetrates into the target atom and it can remove some of the _K_\-shell electrons. Then the electrons from outer orbits jump to fill up the vacancy so created in the _K_\-shell. During the downward transition, the energy difference between the levels is given out in the form of x– ray photon of definite wavelength. Such wavelengths, characteristic of the target, constitute the line spectrum.

From the Figure 8.23, it is evident that _K_\-series of lines in the x-ray spectrum of an element arises due to the electronic transitions from _L_, _M_, _N_, . . levels to the _K_\-level. Similarly, the longer wavelength _L_\-series originates when an _L_\-electron is knocked out of the atom and the corresponding vacancy is filled by the
  

electronic transitions from _M_, _N_, _O_ level to the L-level and so on.

The _Kα_ and _Kβ_ of the _K_\-series of molybdenum are shown by the two peaks in its x-ray spectrum in Figure 8.21(b).

**Applications of x-rays:** X-rays are being used in many fields.

Let us list a few of them.

_ible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial_ – Ernest Rutherford

In earlier classes, we have studied that anything which occupies space is called matter. Matter can be classified into solids, liquids and gases. In our daily life, we use water for drinking, petrol for vehicles, we inhale oxygen, stainless steel vessels for cooking, etc. Experiences tell us that behaviour of one material is not the same as that of another, which means that the physical and chemical properties are different for different materials. In order to understand this, we need to know the fundamental constituents of materials.




  

When an object is divided repeatedly, the process of division could not be done beyond a certain stage in a similar way and we end up with a small speck. This small speck was defined as an atom. The word atom in Greek means ‘without division or indivisible’. The size of an atom is very very small. For an example, the size of hydrogen atom (simplest among other atoms) is around 10–10 m. An American Physicist Richard P. Feynman said that if the size of an atom becomes the size of an apple, then the size of apple becomes the size of the earth as shown in Figure 9.1. Such a small entity is an atom.

In this unit, we first discuss the theoretical models of atom to understand its structure. The Bohr atom model is more successful than J. J. Thomson and Rutherford atom models. It explained many unsolved issues in those days and also gave better understanding of chemistry.

Later, scientists observed that even the atom is not the fundamental entity. It consists of electrons and nucleus. Around 1930, scientists discovered that nucleus is also made of proton and neutron. Further research discovered that even the proton and neutron are made up of fundamental entities known as quarks.

In this context, the remaining part of this unit is written to understand the structure and basic properties of nucleus. Further how the nuclear energy is produced and utilized are discussed.

**ELECTRIC DISCHARGE THROUGH GASES**

Gases at normal atmospheric pressure are poor conductors of electricity because they do not have free electrons for conduction.

**9.2**  

But by special arrangement, one can make a gas to conduct electricity.

A simple and convenient device used to study the conduction of electricity through gases is known as gas discharge tube. The arrangement of discharge tube is shown in Figure 9.2. It consists of a long closed glass tube (of length nearly 50 cm and diameter of 4 cm) inside of which a gas in pure form is filled usually. The small opening in the tube is connected to a high vacuum pump and a low-pressure gauge. This tube is fitted with two metallic plates known as electrodes which are connected to secondary of an induction coil. The electrode connected to positive of secondary is known as anode and the electrode to the negative of the secondary is cathode. The potential of secondary is maintained at about 50 kV.

**(b)**




  

Suppose the pressure of the gas in discharge tube is reduced to around 110 mm of Hg using vacuum pump, it is observed that no discharge takes place. When the pressure is kept near 100 mm of Hg, the discharge of electricity through the tube takes place. Consequently, irregular streaks of light appear and also crackling sound is produced. When the pressure is reduced to the order of 10 mm of Hg, a luminous column known as positive column is formed from anode to cathode.

When the pressure reaches to around 0.01 mm of Hg, positive column disappears. At this time, a dark space is formed between anode and cathode which is often called Crooke’s dark space and the walls of the tube appear with green colour. At this stage, some invisible rays emanate from cathode called cathode rays, which are later found be a beam of electrons.

**Properties of cathode rays** (1) Cathode rays possess energy and

momentum and travel in a straight line with high speed of the order of 107 ms-1. It can be deflected by application of electric and magnetic fields. The direction of deflection indicates that they contain negatively charged particles.

(2) When the cathode rays are allowed to fall on matter, heat is produced. Cathode rays affect the photographic plates and also produce fluorescence when they fall on certain crystals and minerals.

(3) When the cathode rays fall on a material of high atomic weight, x-rays are produced.

(4) Cathode rays ionize the gas through which they pass.  

(5) The speed of cathode rays is up to 1

**Thomson’s experiment**

Thomson’s experiment is considered as one among the landmark experiments for the birth of modern physics. In 1887, J. J. Thomson made remarkable improvement in the study of gases in discharge tubes. In the presence of electric and magnetic fields, the cathode rays were deflected. By the variation of electric and magnetic fields, the specific charge (charge per unit mass) of the cathode rays is measured.

**Figure 9.3 Arrangement of J.J. Thomson** experiment to determine the specific charge of an electron

The arrangement of J. J. Thomson’s experiment is shown in Figure 9.3. A highly evacuated discharge tube is used and cathode rays (electron beam) produced at cathode are attracted towards anode disc A. Anode disc is provided with pin hole in order to allow only a narrow beam of cathode rays. These cathode rays are now allowed to pass through the parallel metal plates which are maintained at high voltage as shown in Figure 9.3. Further, the gas

discharge tube is kept in between pole pieces of magnet such that both electric and magnetic fields are acting perpendicular to each other. When the cathode rays strike the screen, they produce scintillation and hence bright spot is observed. This is achieved by coating the screen with zinc sulphide.

**Figure 9.4** Electric force balancing the magnetic force – the path of electron beam is a straight line

For a fixed electric field between the plates, the magnetic field is adjusted such that the cathode rays (electron beam) strike at the original position O (Figure 9.3). This means that the magnitude of electric force is balanced by the magnitude of force due to magnetic field as shown in Figure 9.4. Let _e_ be the charge of the cathode rays, then

_eE eB_\= υ

(9.1)  

**(ii) Determination of specific charge** Since the cathode rays (electron beam)

are accelerated from cathode to anode, the potential energy of the electron beam at the cathode is converted into kinetic energy of the electron beam at the anode. Let _V_ be the potential difference between anode and cathode, then the potential energy is _eV_. Then from law of conservation of energy,

**9.2.2 Determination of charge of an electron – Millikan’s oil drop experiment**

Millikan’s oil drop experiment is another important experiment in modern physics which is used to determine one of the fundamental constants of nature known as charge of an electron (Figure 9.6 (a)).

By adjusting electric field suitably, the motion of oil drop inside the chamber can be controlled – that is, it can be made to move up or down or even kept balanced in the field of view for sufficiently long time.

The experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 9.6 (b). The apparatus consists of two horizontal circular metal plates A and B each with diameter around 20 cm and are separated by a small distance 1.5 cm. These two parallel

plates are enclosed in a chamber with glass walls. Further, plates A and B are maintained at high potential difference around 10 _kV_ such that electric field acts vertically downward. A small hole is made at the centre of the upper plate A and an atomizer is kept exactly above the hole to spray the liquid. When a fine droplet of the highly viscous non volatile liquid (like glycerine) is sprayed using atomizer, they fall freely downward through the hole of the top plate only under the influence of gravity.

Few oil drops in the chamber can acquire electric charge (negative charge) because of friction with air or passage of x-rays in between the parallel plates. Further the chamber is illuminated by light which is passed horizontally and oil drops can be seen clearly using microscope placed perpendicular to the light beam.

These drops can move either upwards or downward.

Let _m_ be the mass of the oil drop and _q_ be its charge. Then the forces acting on the droplet are

**(a) Determination of radius of the droplet**

When the electric field is switched off, the oil drop accelerates downwards. Due to the presence of air drag forces, the oil drops easily attain its terminal velocity and moves with constant velocity. This velocity can be carefully measured by noting down the time taken by the oil drop to fall through a predetermined distance. The free body diagram of the oil drop is shown in Figure 9.7 (a), we note that viscous force and buoyant force balance the gravitational force.

Let the gravitational force acting on the oil drop (downward) be _F mgg_ \=

Let us assume that oil drop to be spherical in shape. Let ρ be the density of the oil drop,




  

and _r_ be the radius of the oil drop, then the mass of the oil drop can be expressed in terms of its density as

**(b) Determination of electric charge** When the electric field is switched on,

charged oil drops experience an upward electric force (_qE_). Among many drops, one particular drop can be chosen in the field of view of microscope and strength of the electric field is adjusted to make that particular drop to be stationary. Under these circumstances, there will be no viscous force acting on the oil drop. Then, from the free body diagram shown Figure 9.7 (b), the net force acting on the oil droplet is

**ATOM MODELS**

**Introduction** Around 400 B.C, Greek philosophers

Leucippus and Democretus proposed the concept of atom, ‘Every object on continued subdivision ultimately yields atoms’. Later, many physicists and chemists tried to understand the nature with the idea of atoms. Many theories were proposed to explain the properties (physical and chemical) of bulk materials on the basis of atomic model.

For instance, J. J. Thomson proposed a theoretical atom model which is based on static distribution of electric charges. Since this model fails to explain the stability of atom, one of his students E. Rutherford proposed the first dynamic model of an atom. Rutherford gave atom model which is based on results of an experiment done by his students (Geiger and Marsden). But this model also failed to explain the stability of the atom.

Later, Niels Bohr who is also a student of Rutherford proposed an atomic model for hydrogen atom which is more successful than other two models. Niels Bohr atom model could explain the stability of the atom and also the origin of line spectrum. There are other atom models, such as Sommerfeld’s atom model and atom model from wave mechanics (quantum mechanics). But we will restrict ourselves only to very simple (mathematically simple) atom model in this section.

**9.3**  

**9.3.1 J. J. Thomson’s Model (Water melon model)**

In this model, the atoms are visualized as homogeneous spheres which contain uniform distribution of positively charged particles (Figure 9.8 (a)). The negatively charged particles known as electrons are embedded in it like seeds in water melon as shown in Figure 9.8 (b).

The atoms are electrically neutral, this implies that the total positive charge in an atom is equal to the total negative charge. According to this model, all the charges are assumed to be at rest. But from classical electrodynamics, no stable equilibrium points exist in electrostatic configuration (this is known as Earnshaw’s theorem) and hence such an atom cannot be stable. Further, it fails to explain the origin of spectral lines observed in the spectrum of hydrogen atom and other atoms.

**9.3.2 Rutherford’s model**

In 1911, Geiger and Marsden did a remarkable experiment based on the advice of their teacher Rutherford, which is known as scattering of alpha particles by gold foil.

The experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 9.9. A source of alpha particles (radioactive material, example polonium) is




  

kept inside a thick lead box with a fine hole as seen in Figure 9.9. The alpha particles coming through the fine hole of lead box pass through another fine hole made on the lead screen. These particles are now allowed to fall on a thin gold foil and it is observed that the alpha particles passing through gold foil are scattered through different angles. A movable screen (from 0° to 180°) which is made up of zinc sulphide (ZnS) is kept on the other side of the gold foil to collect the scattered alpha particles. Whenever alpha particles strike the screen, a flash of light is observed which can be seen through a microscope.

Rutherford proposed an atom model based on the results of alpha scattering

The results of this experiment are given below and are shown in Figure 9.10, Rutherford expected the atom model to be as seen in Figure 9.10 (a) but the experiment showed the model as in Figure 9.10 (b). (a) Most of the alpha particles were

un-deflected through the gold foil and went straight.

In Figure 9.10 (c), the dotted points are the alpha scattering experiment data points obtained by Geiger and Marsden and the solid curve is the prediction from Rutherford’s nuclear model. It is observed that the Rutherford’s nuclear model is in good agreement with the experimental data.

**Conclusion made by Rutherford based on the above observation**

From the experimental observations, Rutherford proposed that an atom has a lot of empty space and contains a tiny matter at its centre known as nucleus whose size is of the order of 10-14m. The nucleus is positively charged and most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Since static charge distribution cannot be in a stable equilibrium, he suggested that the electrons are not at rest and they revolve around the nucleus in circular orbits like planets revolving around the sun.

**Figure 9.11** Distance of closest approach and impact parameter

When an alpha particle moves straight towards the nucleus, it reaches a point where it comes to rest momentarily and returns back as shown in Figure 9.11. **The minimum distance between the centre**  

**of the nucleus and the alpha particle just before it gets reflected back through 180**° **is defined as the distance of closest approach r0 (also known as contact distance)**. At this distance, all the kinetic energy of the alpha particle will be converted into electrostatic potential energy (Refer unit 1, volume 1 of +2 physics text book).

where _Ek_ is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle.This is used to estimate the size of the nucleus but size of the nucleus is always lesser than the distance of closest approach.

**Drawbacks of Rutherford model** Rutherford atom model helps in the

calculation of the diameter of the nucleus and also the size of the atom but has the following limitations:

(a) This model fails to explain the distribution of electrons around the nucleus and also the stability of the atom.

**Instability of atom**

**_e\__** \+ \_

**Figure 9.13** Spiral in motion of an electron around the nucleus

According to classical electrodynamics, any accelerated charge should emit electromagnetic radiations continuously. Due to emission of radiations, the charge loses its energy. Hence, it can no longer sustain the circular motion. The radius of the orbit, therefore, becomes smaller and smaller (undergoes spiral motion) as shown in Figure 9.13 and finally the electron should fall into the nucleus and the atoms should disintegrate. But this does not happen.  

Hence, Rutherford model could not account for the stability of atoms.

(b) According to this model, emission of radiation must be continuous and must give continuous emission spectrum but experimentally we observe only line (discrete) emission spectrum for atoms.

**9.3.3 Bohr atom model**

In order to overcome the limitations of the Rutherford atom model in explaining the stability and also the line spectrum observed for a hydrogen atom (Figure 9.14), Niels Bohr made modifications in Rutherford atom model. He is the first person to give better theoretical model of the structure of an atom to explain the line spectrum of hydrogen atom. The following are the assumptions (postulates) made by Bohr.

**Figure 9.14 The line spectrum of** hydrogen

**Postulates of Bohr atom model:** (a) The electron in an atom moves

around nucleus in circular orbits under the influence of Coulomb electrostatic force of attraction. This Coulomb force gives necessary centripetal force for the electron to undergo circular motion.

(b) Electrons in an atom revolve around the nucleus only in certain discrete orbits called stationary orbits and electron in such orbits do not radiate electromagnetic energy. Only those discrete orbits allowed are stable orbits.

The angular momentum of the electron in these stationary orbits are quantized – that is, it can be written as an integer or integral

called as reduced Planck’s

constant – that is,  (read it as h-bar) and the integer _n_ is called as principal quantum number.

_l n_\= 

where = _h_ 2π

This condition is known as angular momentum quantization condition.

According to quantum mechanics, particles like electrons have dual nature (Refer unit 8, volume 2 of +2 physics text book). The standing wave pattern of the de Broglie wave associated with orbiting electron in a stable orbit is shown in Figure 9.15.

**Figure 9.15** Standing wave pattern for electron in a stable orbit  

The circumference of an electron’s orbit of radius _r_ must be an integral multiple of de Broglie wavelength – that is,

2π λ_r n_\= (9.14) where n = 1,2,3,......

But the de Broglie wavelength (_λ_) associated with an electron of mass _m_ moving with velocity _υ_ is λ

υ = _h_

_m_ where _h_ is called

Planck’s constant. Thus from equation (9.14),

For any particle of mass _m_ undergoing circular motion with radius _r_ and velocity _υ_, the magnitude of angular momentum _l_ is given by

_l r m_\= ( )υ _m r l n_υ = = 

(c) Energy of the electron in orbits is not continuous but only discrete. This is called the quantization of energy. An electron can jump from one orbit to another orbit by absorbing or emitting a photon whose energy is equal to the difference in energy (ΔE) between the two orbital levels (Figure 9.16)

∆_E E E hv h c final initial_\= − = =

λ where _c_ is the speed of light and λ is the

wavelength and _v_ is the frequency of the radiation emitted. Thus, the frequency of the radiation emitted is related only to change in atomic energy levels and it does not depend on frequency of orbital motion of the electron.

**Radius of the orbit of the electron and velocity of the electron**

Consider an atom which contains the nucleus at rest and an electron revolving around the nucleus in a circular orbit of radius _rn_ as shown in Figure 9.17. Nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Since proton is positively charged and neutron is electrically neutral, the charge of a nucleus is entirely due to the charge of protons.

**EXAMPLE 9.1**

The radius of the 5th orbit of hydrogen atom is 13.25 Å. Calculate the de broglie wavelength of the electron orbitting in the 5th orbit.

**Solution:**

2π_r = nλ_ 2 × 3.14 × 13.25Å = 5 × _λ_ ∴ _λ_ = 16.64Å

_r a nn_ \= 0 2

For _n_ = 1 (first orbit or ground state),

r1 = a0 = 0.529 Å

For n = 2 (second orbit or first excited state),

r2 = 4a0 = 2.116 Å

For n = 3 (third orbit or second excited state),

r3 = 9a0 = 4.761 Å

and so on.

Thus the radius of the orbit from centre increases with _n_, that is, _rn_ ∝ _n2_ as shown in Figure 9.18.

_E n_

_eVn_ \=−13 6 1 2.

For the first orbit (ground state), the total energy of electron is E1= – 13.6 _eV_. For the second orbit (first excited state), the total energy of electron is E2= –3.4 _eV_. For the third orbit (second excited state), the total energy of electron is E3= –1.51 _eV_ and so on.  

Notice that the energy of the first excited state is greater than that of the ground state, second excited state is greater than that of the first excited state and so on. Thus, the orbit which is closest to the nucleus (_r_1) has lowest energy (minimum energy what it is compared with other orbits). So, it is often called ground state energy (lowest energy state). The ground state energy of hydrogen (–13.6 _eV_ ) is used as a unit of energy called Rydberg (1 Rydberg = –13.6 _eV_ ).

The negative value of this energy is because of the way the zero of the potential energy is defined. When the electron is taken away to an infinite distance (very far distance) from nucleus, both the potential energy and kinetic energy terms vanish and hence the total energy also vanishes.

The energy level diagram along with the shape of the orbits for increasing values of _n_ are shown in Figure 9.20. It shows that the energies of the excited states come closer and closer together when the principal quantum number _n_ takes higher values.

In 1931, H.C. Urey and co- workers noticed that in the shorter wavelength region

of the hydrogen spectrum lines, faint companion lines are observed. From the isotope displacement effect (isotope shift), the isotope of the same element can produce slightly different spectral lines. The presence of these faint lines confirmed the existence of isotopes of hydrogen atom (which is named as Deuterium).

On calculating wavelength or wave number difference between the faint and bright spectral lines, atomic mass of deuterium is measured to be twice that of atomic mass of hydrogen atom. Bohr atom model could not explain this isotopic shift. Thus by considering nuclear motion (although the movement of the nucleus is much smaller) into account in the Bohr atom model, the wave number or wavelength difference between the lines produces by the hydrogen atom and deuterium is theoretically calculated which perfectly agreed with the spectroscopic measured values.

The difference between hydrogen atom and deuterium is in the number of neutron. Hydrogen atom contains an electron and a proton, whereas deuterium has an electron, a proton and a neutron.

**Note**

**Excitation energy and excitation potential The energy required to excite an**

**electron from lower energy state to any higher energy state is known as excitation energy.**

The excitation energy for an electron from ground state (n = 1) to first excited state (n = 2) is called first excitation energy.

For hydrogen atom, it is  

EI = E2 – E1 = –3.4 _e_V – (–13.6 _e_V) = 10.2 _e_V Similarly, the excitation energy for

an electron from ground state (n = 1) to second excited state (n = 3) is called second excitation energy, which is EII = E3 – E1 = –1.51 _e_V – (–13.6 _e_V) = 12.1 _e_V

and so on. **Excitation potential is defined as**

**excitation energy per unit charge.** For hydrogen atom, the first excitation

state energy is

_E_I = _eV_I

First excitation potential for hydrogen atom is,

⇒ = =_V e_

Similarly, second excitation potential is,

⇒ = =_V e_

_E_II II 1 12 1. volt and so on.

**Ionization energy and ionization potential** An atom is said to be ionized when an

electron is completely removed from the atom – that is, it reaches the state with energy _En_→∞ . **The minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom in the ground state is known as binding energy or ionization energy**.

For all possibilities, no difference in energy is an integer multiple of photon energy. Hence, photon A is not absorbed by this atom. But

**9.3.4 Atomic spectra**

Materials in the solid, liquid and gaseous states emit electromagnetic radiations when they are heated up and these emitted radiations usually exhibit continuous spectrum. For example, when white light is examined through a spectrometer, electromagnetic radiations of all wavelengths are observed which is a continuous spectrum.

In early twentieth century, many scientists spent considerable time in understanding the characteristic radiations emitted by the atoms of individual elements exposed to a flame or




  

electrical discharge. When they were viewed or photographed, instead of a continuous spectrum, the radiation contains of a set of discrete lines, each with characteristic wavelength. In other words, the wavelengths of the radiation obtained are well defined and their positions and intensities are characteristic of the element as shown in Figure 9.21.

This implies that these spectra are unique to each element and can be used to identify the element of the gas (like finger print used to identify a person) – that is, it varies from one gas to another gas. This uniqueness of line spectra of elements made the scientists to determine the composition of stars, sun and also used to identify the unknown compounds.

**Hydrogen spectrum** When the hydrogen gas enclosed in a tube is heated up, it emits electromagnetic radiations of certain sharply-defined characteristic wavelength (line spectrum), called hydrogen emission spectrum (Refer unit 5, volume 1 of +2 physics text book). The emission spectrum of hydrogen is shown in Figure 9.22(a).

When any gas is heated up, the thermal energy is supplied to excite the electrons. Similarly by all occurring light on the atoms, electrons can be excited. Once the

Since electrons in excited states have very small life time, these electrons jump back to ground state through spontaneous emission in a short duration of time (approximately 10–8 s) by emitting the radiation with same wavelength (or frequency) corresponding to the colours it absorbed (Figure 9.22 (a)). This is called emission spectroscopy.

The wavelengths of these lines can be calculated with great precision. Further, the emitted radiation contains wavelengths both lesser and greater than wavelengths of lines in the visible spectrum.

**Figure 9.23** Spectral series – Lyman, Balmer, Paschen series

Notice that the spectral lines of hydrogen as shown in Figure 9.23 are grouped in separate series. In each series, the distance of separation between the consecutive wavelengths decreases from higher wavelength to the lower wavelength, and also wavelength in each  

series approach a limiting value known as the series limit. These series are named as Lyman series, Balmer series, Paschen series, Brackett series, Pfund series, etc. The wavelengths of these spectral lines perfectly agree with the wavelengths calculate using equation derived from Bohr atom model.

**Limitations of Bohr atom model** The following are the drawbacks of Bohr

atom model (a) Bohr atom model is valid only for

hydrogen atom or hydrogen like-atoms but not for complex atoms.

(b) When the spectral lines are closely examined, individual lines of hydrogen spectrum are accompanied by a number of faint lines. This is called **fine structure**. This cannot be explained by Bohr atom model.

(c) Bohr atom model fails to explain the intensity variations in the spectral lines.

(d) The distribution of electrons in various levels cannot be completely explained by Bohr atom model.  

**NUCLEI**

**Introduction** In the previous section, we have

discussed about various preliminary atom models, Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment and Bohr atom model. These played a vital role to understand the structure of the atom and the nucleus. In this section, the structure of the nuclei and their properties, classifications are discussed.

**9.4.1 Composition of nucleus**

Atoms have a nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. The neutrons are electrically neutral (_q_ \= 0) and the protons have positive charge (_q_ \= + _e_) equal in magnitude to the charge of the electron (_q_ \= –_e_). **The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number** and it is denoted by _Z_**.** The number of neutrons in the nucleus is called neutron number **(_N_). The total number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus is called the mass number** and it is denoted by _A_. Hence, _A_ = _Z_+_N_**.**

The two constituents of nucleus namely neutrons and protons, are collectively called as nucleons. The mass of a proton is 1 6726 10 27. × − kg which is roughly 1836 times the mass of the electron. The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of the proton and it is equal to 1 6749 10 27. × − kg.

To specify the nucleus of any element, we use the following general notation

_Z AX_

where _X_ is the chemical symbol of the element, _A_ is the mass number and _Z_ is the atomic number. For example, the

**9.4**

| 4,5,6..... |Paschen |
| 5,6,7...... |Brackett |
| 6,7,8..... |Pfund |
  

nitrogen nucleus is represented by 7

15_N_ . It implies that nitrogen nucleus contains 15 nucleons of which 7 are protons (_Z_ \= 7) and 8 are neutrons (_N_ \= _A_ – _Z_ \= 8). Note that once the element is specified, the value of _Z_ is known and subscript _Z_ is sometimes omitted. For example, nitrogen nucleus is simply denoted as 15_N_ and we call it as ‘nitrogen fifteen’.

Since the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons, the overall charge of the nucleus is positive and it has the value +_Ze_. But the atom is electrically neutral which implies that the number of electrons in the atom is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus.

**9.4.2 Isotopes, isobars, and isotones**

**Isotopes:** In nature, there are atoms of a particular

element whose nuclei have same number of protons but different number of neutrons. These kinds of atoms are called isotopes. In other words, **isotopes are atoms of the same element having same atomic number _Z_, but different mass number _A_**. For example, hydrogen has three isotopes and they are represented as 1

1_H_ (hydrogen), 1

2_H_ (deuterium),and 1

3_H_ (tritium). Note that all the three nuclei have one proton and, hydrogen has no neutron, deuterium has 1 neutron and tritium has 2 neutrons.

The number of isotopes for the particular element and their relative abundances (percentage) vary with each element. For example, carbon has four main isotopes:

6

11_C_ , 6

12_C_ , 6

13_C_ and 6

14_C_ . But in nature, the percentage of

6

12_C_ is approximately 98.9%, that of 6

13_C_ is 1.1% and that of

6

14_C_ is 0.0001%. The other carbon isotope

6

11_C_ , does not occur naturally  

and it can be produced only in nuclear reactions in the laboratory or by cosmic rays.

Since the chemical properties of any atom are determined only by electrons, the isotopes of any element have same electronic structure and same chemical properties. So the isotopes of the same element are placed in the same location in the periodic table.

**Isobars: Isobars are the atoms of different**

**elements having the same mass number _A_, but different atomic number _Z_**. In other words, isobars are the atoms of different chemical elements which have same number of nucleons. For example

16

40_S_ , 17

40_Cl_ , 18

40 _Ar_ , 19

40_K_ and 20

40_Ca_ are isobars having same mass number 40 but different atomic numbers. Unlike isotopes, isobars are chemically different elements. They have different physical and chemical properties.

**Isotones: Isotones are the atoms of different**

**elements having same number of neutrons**. 5

12_B_ and 6

13_C_ are examples of isotones with 7 neutrons each.

**9.4.3 Atomic and nuclear masses**

The mass of nuclei is very small (about 10-25 kg or less). Therefore, it is more convenient to express it in terms of another unit namely, the _atomic mass unit (u)._ **One atomic mass unit (_u_) is defined as the (1/12)th of the mass of the isotope of carbon**

6

12_C_ which is more abundant in naturally occurring isotope of carbon**.**

In terms of this atomic mass unit, the mass of the neutron = 1.008665 _u_, the mass of the proton =1.007276 _u_, the mass of the hydrogen atom = 1.007825 _u_ and the mass of 6

12 12_C u_\= . Note that usually mass specified is the mass of the atom, not mass of the nucleus. To get the nuclear mass of particular nucleus, the mass of electrons has to be subtracted from the corresponding atomic mass. Experimentally the atomic mass is determined by the instrument called Bainbridge mass spectrometer. If we determine the atomic mass of the element without considering the effect of its isotopes, we get the mass averaged over different isotopes weighted by their abundances.

**EXAMPLE 9.6**

Calculate the average atomic mass of chlorine if no distinction is made between its different isotopes?

**_Solution_**

The element chlorine is a mixture of 75.77% of 17

35_Cl_ and 24.23% of 17 37_Cl_ . So the

average atomic mass will be

In fact, the chemist uses the average atomic mass or simply called chemical atomic weight (35.453 u for chlorine) of an element. So it must be remembered that the atomic mass which is mentioned in the periodic table is basically averaged atomic mass.

**9.4.4 Size and density of the nucleus**

The alpha particle scattering experiment and many other measurements using  

different methods have been carried out on the nuclei of various atoms. The nuclei of atoms are found to be approximately spherical in shape. It is experimentally found that radius of nuclei for _Z_ > 10, satisfies the following empirical formula

_R R A_\= 0

1 3 (9.19)

Here _A_ is the mass number of the nucleus and the constant R0 = 1.2 F, where 1 F = 1 × 10–15 m.The unit fermi (F) is named after Enrico Fermi.

**EXAMPLE 9.7**

Calculate the radius of 79 197 _Au_ nucleus.

**_Solution_**

According to the equation (9.19),

_R m_\= × × = ×− −1 2 10 197 6 97 1015 1 3 15. ( ) .

Or _R =_ 6.97 F

**EXAMPLE 9.8**

Calculate the density of the nucleus with mass number _A_.

By ignoring the mass difference between the proton and neutron, the total mass of the nucleus having mass number _A_ is equal to _A.m_ where _m_ is mass of the proton and is equal to 1.6726 x 10-27 kg.

The above expression shows that the nuclear density is independent of the mass number _A_. In other words, all the nuclei (_Z_ > 10) have the same density and it is an important characteristic property of all nuclei.

We can calculate the numerical value of this density by substituting the corresponding values.

It implies that nucleons are extremely tightly packed or compressed state in the nucleus and compare this density with the density of water which is 103 kg m-3.

A single teaspoon of nuclear matter would weigh about trillion tons.

**9.4.5 Mass defect and binding energy**

It is experimentally found out that the mass of any nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its individual constituent particles. For example, consider the carbon-12 nucleus which is made up of 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Mass of 6 neutrons = 6 1 00866 6 05196× =. ._u u_ Mass of 6 protons = 6 1 00727 6 04362× =. ._u u_  

Mass of 6 electrons = 6 0 00055 0 0033× =. ._u u_

The expected mass of carbon-12 nucleus = 6 05196 6 04362 12 09558. . ._u u u_\+ =

But using mass spectroscopy, the atomic mass of carbon-12 atom is found to be 12 _u_. So if we subtract the mass of 6 electrons (0.0033 _u_) from 12 _u_, we get the nuclear mass of carbon-12 atom which is equal to 11.9967 _u_. Hence the experimental mass of carbon-12 nucleus is less than the total mass of its individual constituents by ∆_m u_\= 0 09888. . This difference in mass ∆_m_ is called mass defect. In general, if M, mp,

and mn are mass of the nucleus ( _Z AX_ ), the

mass of a proton and the mass of a neutron respectively, then the mass defect is given by

∆_m Zm Nm Mp n_\= +( ) − (9.20)

Where has this mass disappeared? The answer was provided by Albert Einstein with the help of famous mass-energy relation ( )_E mc_\= 2 . According to this relation, the mass can be converted into energy and energy can be converted into mass. In the case of the carbon-12 nucleus, when 6 protons and 6 neutrons combine to form carbon-12 nucleus, mass equal to mass defect disappears and an energy equivalent to missing mass. This energy is called the binding energy of the nucleus (BE) and is equal to ∆_m c_( ) 2 . In fact, to separate the carbon-12 nucleus into individual constituents, we must supply the energy equal to binding energy of the nucleus.

We can write the equation (9.20) in terms of binding energy

_BE Zm Nm M cp n_\= + −( ) 2 (9.21)

It is always convenient to work with the mass of the atom rather than with the mass of






| A sin gle t easpoon o f n uclearmatter w ould w eigh a bouttrillion tons. |
|------|------|

  

the nucleus. Hence by adding and subtracting the mass of the _Z_ electrons, we get

_BE Zm Zm Nm M Zm cp e n e_\= + + − −( ) 2 (9.22)

where _m m mp e H_\+ = (mass of hydrogen atom)

_AX_ . Finally, the binding energy in terms of

the atomic masses is given by

**Figure 9.24** Avg. binding energy of the nucleons

Important inferences from of the average binding energy curve:

(1) The value of _BE_ rises as the mass number increases until it reaches a maximum value of 8.8 MeV for A = 56 (iron) and then it slowly decreases.

(2) The average binding energy per nucleon is about 8.5 MeV for nuclei having mass number lying between A = 40 and 120. These elements are comparatively more stable and not radioactive.

(3) For higher mass numbers, the curve drops slowly and _BE_ for uranium is about 7.6 MeV. Such nuclei are unstable and exhibit radioactive.

From Figure 9.24, if two light nuclei with A<28 combine with a nucleus with A<56, the binding energy per nucleon is more for final nucleus than initial nuclei. Thus, if the lighter elements combine to produce a nucleus of medium value A, a large amount of energy will be released. This is the basis of nuclear fusion and is the principle of the hydrogen bomb.

(4) If a nucleus of heavy element is split (fission) into two or more nuclei of medium value A, the energy released would again be large. The atom bomb is based on this principle and huge energy of atom bombs comes from this fission when it is uncontrolled. Fission is explained in the section 9.7

**EXAMPLE 9.10**

**_Solution_**

Binding energy per nucleon = _B E_. = 28.33 MeV/4 \_ ~ 7 MeV.

**NUCLEAR FORCE**

Nucleus of the atoms contains protons and neutrons. From electrostatics, we learnt that like charges repel each other. In the nucleus, since the protons are separated by a distance of about a few fermi (10

15− _m_ ), they must exert on each other a very strong repulsive force.

For example, the electrostatic repulsive force between two protons separated by a distance 10

. . .

This is nearly 10 28 times greater than the

acceleration due to gravity. So if the protons in the nucleus experience only the electrostatic force, then the nucleus would fly apart in an instant. Then how the protons are held together in the nucleus?

From this observation, it was concluded that there must be a strong attractive force between protons to overcome the repulsive Coulombic force. This attractive force which holds the nucleons together is called strong nuclear force. The properties of the nuclear force were understood through various experiments carried out between 1930s and 1950s. A few properties of the nuclear force are (i) The nuclear force is of very short range,

acting only up to a distance of a few fermi. But inside the nucleus, the repulsive Coulomb force or attractive gravitational forces between two protons are much weaker than the nuclear force between two protons. Similarly, the gravitational force between two neutrons is also much weaker than nuclear force between the neutrons. So nuclear force is the strongest force in nature.

(ii) The nuclear force is attractive and acts with an equal strength between proton- proton, proton-neutron, and neutron – neutron.




  

(iii) Nuclear force does not act on the electrons. So it does not alter the chemical properties of the atom.

**RADIOACTIVITY**

In the binding energy curve, the stability of the nucleus that has _Z_ > 82 starts to decrease and these nuclei are fairly unstable nuclei. Some of the unstable decay naturally by emitting certain particles to form a stable nucleus. The elements with atomic number _Z > 82_ and isotopes of lighter nuclei belong to the category of naturally-occurring radioactive nuclei. Each of these radioactive nuclei decays to another nucleus by the emission of

2

4_He_ nucleus ( α-decay) or electron or positron (β-decay) or gamma rays ( γ -decay).

**The phenomenon of spontaneous emission of highly penetrating radiations such as α, β and γ rays by an element is called radioactivity and the substances which emit these radiations are called radioactive elements**. These radioactive elements can be heavy elements (_Z_ > 82), isotopes of lighter and heavy elements and these isotopes are called radioisotopes. For example, carbon isotope

6

14_C_ is radioactive but

6

12_C_ is not. Radioisotopes have a variety of

applications such as carbon dating, cancer treatment, etc. When a radioactive nucleus undergoes decay, the mass of the system decreases – that is, the mass of the initial nucleus before decay is always greater than the sum of the masses of the final nucleus and the emitted particle. This difference in mass ∆_m_ < 0, it appears as the energy according to Einstein’s relation _E m c_\= ∆ 2 .

**9.6**  

The phenomenon of radioactivity was first discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896. Later, Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie did a series of experiments in detail to understand the phenomenon of radioactivity. In India, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Kolkata is the premier institute pursuing active research in nuclear physics.

During early days of nuclear physics research, the term ‘radiation’ was

used to denote the emanations from radioactive nuclei. Now we know that α rays are in fact

2

4_He_ nuclei and β rays are electrons or positrons. Certainly, they are not electromagnetic radiation. The γ ray alone is electromagnetic radiation.

**Note**

**9.6.1 Alpha decay**

When an unstable nucleus decay by emitting an α-particle (

2

4_He_ nucleus), it loses two protons and two neutrons. As a result, its atomic number Z decreases by 2 and the mass number decreases by 4. We write the alpha decay process symbolically in the following way

_Z A_

_Z AX Y He_→ +−

− 2

4

2

4 (9.26)

Here _X_ is called the parent nucleus and _Y_ is called the daughter nucleus.

234_Th_ with the emission of 2

4_He_ nucleus (α-particle)

92

238

90

234

2

4_U Th He_→ +

As already mentioned, the total mass of the daughter nucleus and

2

4_He_ nucleus is always




  

less than that of the parent nucleus. The difference in mass ( ∆_m m m mX Y_\= − − α ) is released as energy called **disintegration energy** _Q_ and is given by

_Q m m m cX Y_\= − −( )α 2 (9.27)

Note that for spontaneous decay (natural radioactivity) _Q_ >0. In alpha decay process, the disintegration energy is certainly positive (_Q_ > 0). In fact, the disintegration energy _Q_ is also the net kinetic energy gained in the decay process or if the parent nucleus is at rest, _Q_ is the total kinetic energy of daughter nucleus and the

2

4_He_ nucleus. Suppose _Q_ < 0, then the decay process cannot occur spontaneously and energy must be supplied to induce the decay.

In alpha decay, why does the unstable nucleus emit

2

4_He_ nucleus? Why it does not emit four separate nucleons? After all

2

4_He_ consists of two protons and two neutrons. For example, if

92

238_U_ nucleus decays into

90

234_Th_ by emitting four separate nucleons (two protons and two neutrons), then the disintegration energy Q for this process turns out to be negative. It implies that the total mass of products is greater than that of parent(

92

238_U_ ) nucleus. This kind of process cannot occur in nature because it would violate conservation of energy. In any decay process, the conservation of energy, laws of linear momentum and laws of angular momentum must be obeyed.

**Note**  

**EXAMPLE 9.11**

This disintegration energy Q appears as the kinetic energy of α particle and the daughter nucleus.

In any decay, the total linear momentum must be conserved.

Total linear momentum of the parent nucleus = total linear momentum of the daughter nucleus and α particle

Since before decay, the uranium nucleus is at rest, its momentum is zero.

By applying conservation of momentum, we get

0= +_m mTh Th_  _v v_α α

**9.6.2 Beta decay**

In beta decay, a radioactive nucleus emits either electron or positron. If electron (_e_–) is emitted, it is called β- decay and if positron (_e_+) is emitted, it is called β+decay. The positron is an anti-particle of an electron whose mass is same as that of electron and charge is opposite to that of electron – that is, +_e_. Both positron and electron are referred to as beta particles.  

β− **decay:** In β- decay, the atomic number of

the nucleus increases by one but its mass number remains the same. This decay is represented by

_Z A_

_Z AX Y e_→ + ++

− 1 ν (9.28)

It implies that the element _X_ becomes _Y_ by giving out an electron and an antineutrino ( ν ). In otherwords, in each β- decay, one neutron in the nucleus of _X_ is converted into a proton by with the emission of an electron (_e_–) and an antineutrino. Thus,

_n p e_→ + +− ν

Where _p_ \-proton, ν -antineutrino. Example: Carbon (

6

14_C_ ) is converted into nitrogen (

7

14 _N_ ) through β- decay.

6 14

7 14_C N e_→ + +− ν

β+ **decay:** In β+ decay, the atomic number is

decreased by one and again its mass number remains the same. This decay is represented by

_Z A_

_Z AX Y e_→ + +−

\+ 1 ν (9.29)

It implies that the element _X_ becomes _Y_ by giving out an positron and neutrino ( ν ). In otherwords, for each β+ decay, a proton in the nucleus _X_ is converted into a neutron a positron (_e_+) and a neutrino. Thus,

_p n e_→ + ++ ν

Example: Sodium ( 11

22 _Na_ ) is converted into neon (

10

22 _Ne_ ) throughβ+decay.

11 22

10 22_Na Ne e_→ + ++ ν

However a single proton (not inside any nucleus) cannot exhibit β+ decay due to energy conservation, because neutron mass is larger than proton mass. But a single




  

neutron (not inside any nucleus) can exhibit β- decay.

It is important to note that the electron or positron which comes out from nuclei during beta decay are not present inside the nuclei but they are produced only during the conversion of neutron into proton or proton into neutron inside the nucleus.

**Neutrino:** Initially, it was thought that during

beta decay, a neutron in the parent nucleus is converted into the daughter nuclei by emitting only electron as given by

_Z A_

_Z AX Y e_→ ++

− 1 (9.30)

But the kinetic energy of electron coming out of the nucleus did not match with the experimental results. In alpha decay, the alpha particle takes only certain allowed discrete energies whereas in beta

decay, it was found that the beta particle (i.e, electron) has a continuous range of energies. But the conservation of energy and momentum gives specific single values for energy of electron and the recoiling nucleus Y. It seems that the conservation of energy, momentum are violated and could not be explained why energy of beta particle having continuous range of values. So beta decay remained as a puzzle for several years.

After a detailed theoretical and experimental study in 1931, W.Pauli proposed a third particle which must be emitted in the beta decay process carrying away missing energy and momentum. Fermi later named this particle as _neutrino_ (little neutral one) since it mass is small and is neutral carrying no charge. For many years, the neutrino (symbol ν , Greek _nu_) was hypothetical and could not be verified experimentally. Finally, the neutrino was

The neutrino has the following properties

· It has zero charge · It has an antiparticle called anti-neutrino. · Recent experiments showed that the

neutrino has very small mass. · It interacts very weakly with the matter.

Therefore, it is very difficult to detect it. In fact, in every second, trillions of neutrinos coming from the sun are passing through our body without causing interaction.

**9.6.3 Gamma emission**

In α and β decay, the daughter nucleus is in the excited state most of the time. The typical life time of excited state is approximately 10-11s. So this excited state nucleus immediately returns to the ground state or lower energy state by emitting highly energetic photons called γ rays. In fact, when the atom is in the excited state, it returns to the ground state by emitting photons of energy in the order of few eV. But when the excited state nucleus returns to its ground state, it emits a highly energetic photon (γ rays) of energy in the order of MeV. The gamma emission is given by

_Z A_

Here the asterisk(\*) indicates the excited state nucleus. In gamma emission, there is no change in the mass number or atomic number of the nucleus.

Boron ( 5

In the previous section, the decay process of a single radioactive nucleus was discussed. In practice, we have bulk material of radioactive sample which contains a vast number of the radioactive nuclei and not all the radioactive nucleus in a sample

decay at the same time. It decays over a period of time and this decay is basically a random process. It implies that we cannot predict which nucleus is going to decay or rather we can determine like probabilistic basis (like tossing a coin). We can calculate approximately how many nuclei in a sample are decayed over a period of time.

At any instant _t_, the number of decays per unit time, called rate of decay _dN_

_dt_       is

proportional to the number of nuclei ( _N_ ) at the same instant.

_dN dt_

_N_∝

By introducing a proportionality constant, the relation can be written as

_dN dt_

_N_\=−λ (9.32)

Here proportionality constant λ is called decay constant which is different for different radioactive sample and the negative sign in the equation implies that _N_ is decreasing with time.

By rewriting the equation (9.32), we get

_dN Ndt_\=−λ (9.33)

Here _dN_ represents the number of nuclei decaying in the time interval _dt_.

Let us assume that at time _t_ = _0_ s, the number of nuclei present in the radioactive sample be _N_0 . By integrating the equation (9.33), we can calculate the number of undecayed nuclei _N_ present at any time _t._

From equation (9.33), we get

radioactive decay. Here _N_ denotes the number of undecayed nuclei present at any time _t_ and _N_0 denotes the number of nuclei present initially time _t=0_. Note that the number of atoms is decreasing exponentially over the length of time. This implies that the time taken for all the radioactive nuclei to decay will be infinite. Equation (9.35) is plotted in Figure 9.26.

We can also define another useful quantity called activity (R) or decay rate which is the number of nuclei decayed per

second and it is denoted as _R dN dt_

\= . Note

that activity R is a positive quantity. From equation (9.35), we get

_R dN dt_

_R R e t_\= − 0

λ (9.37)




  

where _R N_0 0= λ

The equation (9.37) is also equivalent to radioactive law of decay. Here _R_0 is the activity of the sample at _t_\=_0_ and _R_ is the activity of the sample at any time _t_. From equation (9.37), activity also shows exponential decay behavior. The activity _R_ also can be expressed in terms of number of undecayed atoms present at any time _t_.

From equation (9.37), since _N N e t_\= − 0

λ , we write

_R N_\= λ (9.38)

Equation (9.38) implies that the activity at any time _t_ is equal to the product of decay constant and number of undecayed nuclei present at that time _t_. Since _N_ decreases with time, _R_ also decreases.

The SI unit of activity _R_ is Becquerel and one Becquerel (Bq) is equal to one decay per second. There is also another standard unit for the activity called Curie(Ci).

**Note**

**9.6.5 Half-life**

It is difficult to calculate the time taken by a given a sample of N atoms to decay completely. However, we can calculate the time taken by the given sample of atoms to reduce some fraction of the initial amount.

**We can define the half-life** _T_ 1 2/

**as the time required for the number of atoms**  

**initially present to reduce to one half of the initial amount.**

The half-life is the important characteristic of every radioactive sample. Some radioactive nuclei are known to have half-life as long as 1014 years and some nuclei have very shorter half-life time (10-14s).

We can express half-life in terms of the decay constant. At _t T_\=

undecayed nuclei _N N_ \= 0

By substituting this value in to the equation (9.35), we get

Taking logarithm on both sides and rearranging the terms,

(9.39)

One should not think that shorter half-life material is safer than longer half-

life material because it will not last long. The shorter half-life sample will have higher activity and it is more ‘radioactive’ which is more harmful.

**Note**

If the number of atoms present at t=0

2 atoms remain undecayed

in first half-life and _N_ 0

(9.40)

where _n_ can be integer or non-integer. Since the activity of radioactive sample also




  

obeys the exponential decay law, we can also write an equation for an activity similar to equation (9.36).

After _n_ half-lives, the activity or decay rate of any radioactive sample is

**Mean life (τ):** When the radioactive nucleus decays,

the nucleus which disintegrates first has zero life time and the nucleus which decays last has an infinite lifetime. The actual life time for each nucleus varies from zero to infinity. Therefore, it is meaningful to define average life or mean life time t, that the nucleus survives before it decays.

**The mean life time of the nucleus is the ratio of sum or integration of life times of all nuclei to the total number nuclei present initially.**

The total number of nuclei decaying in the time interval from _t_ to _t t_+∆ is equal to _R t N e tt_∆ ∆= −λ λ

0 . It implies that until the time _t_, this _R t_∆ number of nuclei lived. So the life time of these _R t_∆ nuclei is equal to _tR t_∆ . In the limit ∆_t_ ® 0 , the total life time of all the nuclei would be the integration of _tRdt_ from the limit _t t_\= =∞0 to .

**9.6.6 Carbon dating**

The interesting application of beta decay is radioactive dating or carbon dating. Using this technique, the age of an ancient object can be calculated. All living organisms absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from air to synthesize organic molecules. In this absorbed CO2, the major part contains

6

12_C_ and very small fraction (1 3 10

12 . × − ) contains

radioactive 6

14_C_ whose half-life is 5730 years. Carbon-14 in the atmosphere is always

decaying but at the same time, cosmic rays from outer space are continuously bombarding the atoms in the atmosphere which produces

6

14_C_ . So the continuous production and decay of

6

14_C_ in the atmosphere keep the ratio of

6

14_C_ to 6

12_C_ always constant. Since our human body, tree or any living organism continuously absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, the ratio of

6

14_C_ to 6

12_C_ in the living organism is also nearly constant. But when the organism




  

dies, it stops absorbing CO2. Since 6

14_C_ starts to decay, the ratio of

6

14_C_ to 6

12_C_ in a dead organism or specimen decreases over the years. Suppose the ratio of

6

14_C_ to 6

12_C_ in the ancient tree pieces excavated is known, then the age of the tree pieces can be calculated.

**EXAMPLE 9.14**

Keezhadi (கீழடி), a small hamlet, has become one of the very important archeological places of Tamilandu. It is located in Sivagangai district. A lot of artefacts (gold coins, pottery, beads, iron tools, jewellery and charcoal, etc.) have been unearthed in Keezhadi which have given substantial evidence that an ancient urban civilization had thrived on the banks of river Vaigai. To determine the age of those materials, the charcoal of 200 g sent for carbon dating is given in the following figure (b). The activity of

6

14_C_ is found to be 37 decays/s. Calculate the age of charcoal.

**Figure (a)** Keezhadi – excavation site

**Figure (b)** – Characol which was sent for carbon dating  

**_Solution_**

To calculate the age, we need to know the initial activity (R0) of the characol (when the sample was alive).

To find the initial activity _R_0 , we use the equation _R N_0 0= λ . Here _N_0 is the number of carbon-14 atoms present in the sample when it was alive. The mass of the characol is 200 g. In 12 g of carbon, there are 6 02 10

In fact, the excavated materials were to USA sent for carbon dating by Archeological Department of Tamilnadu and the report confirmed that the age of Keezhadi artefacts lies between 2200 years to 2500 years (Sangam era- 400 BC to 200 BC). The Keezhadi excavations experimentally proved that urban civilization existed in Tamil Nadu even 2000 years ago!

**9.6.7 Discovery of Neutrons**

In 1930, two German physicists Bothe and Becker found that when beryllium was bombarded with α particles, highly penetrating radiation was emitted. This radiation was capable of penetrating the thick layer of lead and was unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields. Initially, it was thought as γ radiation. But in the year 1932, James Chadwick discovered that those radiations are not EM waves but they contain uncharged particles of mass little greater than the mass of the proton. He called them as neutrons. The above reaction can be written as

1_Be He C n_\+ → +

where 0

1_n_ denotes neutron.

Neutrons are fairly stable inside the nucleus. But outside the nucleus they are unstable. If the neutron comes out of the nucleus (free neutron), it decays  

with emission of proton, electron, and antineutrino with the half life of 13 minutes.

Neutrons are classified according to their kinetic energy as (i) slow neutrons (0 to 1000 eV) (ii) fast neutrons (0.5 MeV to 10 MeV). The neutrons with average energy of about 0.025 eV in thermal equilibrium are called thermal neutron, because at 298K, the thermal energy _kT eV_ 0 025. . Slow and fast neutrons play a vital role in nuclear reactors.

**NUCLEAR FISSION**

In 1939, German scientists Otto Hahn and F. Strassman discovered that when uranium nucleus is bombarded with a slow neutron, it breaks up into two smaller nuclei of comparable masses with the release of energy. **The process of breaking up of the nucleus of a heavier atom into two smaller nuclei with the release of a large amount of energy is called nuclear fission**. The fission is accompanied by the release of neutrons. The energy that is released in the nuclear fission is of many orders of magnitude greater than the energy released in chemical reactions.

Uranium undergoes fission reaction in 90 different ways. The most common fission reactions of

92

235_U_ nuclei are shown here.

**9.7**




  

this excited state does not last longer than 10-12s and decay into two daughter nuclei along with the release of 2 or 3 neutrons. In each reaction, on an average, 2.5 neutrons are emitted. It is shown in Figure 9.27

So the energy released in each fission = 0 225303 931 200. × ≈_MeV MeV_

This energy first appears as kinetic energy of daughter nuclei and neutrons. But later, this kinetic energy appears in the form of heat given to the surrounding.

**Chain reaction:** When one

92

235_U_ nucleus undergoes fission, the energy released might be small. But from each fission reaction, three neutrons are released. These three neutrons can cause further fission in three other

92

235_U_ nuclei which in turn produce nine neutrons. These nine neutrons initiate fission in another nine

92

235_U_ nuclei which produces 27 neutrons and so on. This process is called a chain reaction and the number of neutrons goes on increasing almost in geometric progression. It is shown in Figure 9.28.

There are two kinds of chain reactions: (i) uncontrolled chain reaction (ii) controlled chain reaction. In an uncontrolled chain reaction, the number of neutrons multiply indefinitely and the entire amount of energy is released in a fraction of second.

The atom bomb is an example of nuclear fission reaction in which uncontrolled chain reaction occurs. Atom bombs produce massive destruction on mankind. During World War II, on August 6 and 9 in the year 1945, USA dropped two atom bombs in two places of Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As a result, lakhs of people were killed and the two cities were completely destroyed. Even now the people who are living in those places have side effects caused by the explosion of atom bombs.

It is possible to calculate the typical energy released in a chain reaction. In the first step,




  

one neutron initiates the fission process in one nucleus by producing three neutrons and energy of about 200 MeV. In the second step, further three nuclei undergo fission, in third step nine nuclei undergo fission, in fourth step 27 nucleus undergo fission and so on. In the 100th step, the number of nuclei which undergo fission is around 2 5 10

40 . ×

. The total energy released after 100th step is 2 5 10 200 8 10

40 29 . × × = ×_MeV J_ . It is really

an enormous amount of energy which is equivalent to electrical energy required in Tamilnadu for several years.

If the chain reaction is controllable, then we can harvest an the enormous amount of energy for our needs. It is achieved in a controlled chain reaction. In the controlled chain reaction, the average number of neutrons released in each stage is kept as one such that it is possible to store the released energy. In nuclear reactors, the controlled chain reaction is carried out and the produced energy is used for power generation or for research purpose.

One incoming neutron causes a ssion event in

a 235U nucleus.

e number of neutrons and the number of ssion events grow rapidly.

Several neutrons from the initial ssion event cause ssion in additional 235U nuclei.

This is enormously large amount of energy which is enough to keep 100 W bulb operating for 30,000 years. To produce this much energy by chemical reaction, around 20,000 tons of TNT(tri nitro toluene) has to be exploded.

**Nuclear reactor:** Nuclear reactor is a device in which the

nuclear fission takes place in a self-sustained controlled manner and the energy produced is used either for research purpose or for power generation. The first nuclear reactor was built in the year 1942 at Chicago, USA by physicist Enrico Fermi. The main parts of a nuclear reactor are fuel, moderator and control rods. In addition to this, there is a cooling system which is connected with power generation set up.

**Fuel:** The fuel is fissionable material, usually uranium or plutonium. Naturally occurring uranium contains only 0.7% of

92

235_U_ and 99.3% are only

92

238_U_ . So the 92

238_U_ must be enriched such that it contains at least 2% to 4% of

92

235_U_ . In addition to this, a neutron source is required to initiate the chain reaction for the first time. A mixture of beryllium

**Shielding**

**Figure 9.29** (a) Block diagram of Nuc  

with plutonium or polonium is used as the neutron source. During fission of

92

235_U_ , only fast neutrons are emitted but the probability of initiating fission by it in another nucleus is very low. Therefore, slow neutrons are preferred for sustained nuclear reactions.

**Moderators:** The moderator is a material used to convert fast neutrons into slow neutrons. Usually the moderators are chosen in such a way that they must be very light nuclei having mass comparable to that of neutrons. Hence, these light nuclei undergo collision with fast neutrons and the speed of the neutron is reduced (Note that a billiard ball striking a stationary billiard ball of equal mass would itself be stopped but the same billiard ball bounces off almost with same speed when it strikes a heavier mass. This is the reason for using lighter nuclei as moderators). Most of the reactors use heavy water (D2O) and graphite as moderators. The blocks of uranium stacked together with blocks of graphite (the moderator) to form a large pile is shown in the Figure 9.29 (a) & (b).

**Control rods:** The control rods are used to adjust the reaction rate. During each fission, on an average 2.5 neutrons are emitted and in order to have the controlled chain reactions, only one neutron is allowed to cause another fission and the remaining neutrons are absorbed by the control rods.

Usually cadmium or boron acts as control rod material and these rods are inserted into the uranium blocks as shown in the Figure 9.29 (a) and (b). Depending on the insertion depth of control rod into the uranium assembly, the average number of neutrons produced per fission is set to be equal to one or greater than one. If the average number of neutrons produced per fission is equal to one, then reactor is said to be in critical state. In fact, all the nuclear reactors are maintained in critical state by suitable adjustment of control rods. If it is greater than one, then reactor is said to be in super-critical and it may explode sooner or may cause massive destruction.

**Shielding:** For a protection against harmful radiations, the nuclear reactor is

**Cooling system:**The cooling system removes the heat generated in the reactor core. Ordinary water, heavy water and liquid sodium are used as coolant since they have very high specific heat capacity and have large boiling point under high pressure. This coolant passes through the fuel block and carries away the heat to the steam generator through heat exchanger as shown in Figure 9.29(a) and (b). The steam runs the turbines which produces electricity in power reactors.

India has 22 nuclear reactors in operation. Nuclear reactors are constructed in

two places in Tamilnadu, Kalpakkam and Kudankulam. Even though nuclear reactors are aimed to cater to our energy need, in practice nuclear reactors now are able to provide only 2% of energy requirement of India.

**NUCLEAR FUSION**

**When two or more light nuclei (_A_<20) combine to form a heavier nucleus, then it is called nuclear fusion**. In the nuclear fusion, the mass of the resultant nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of original light nuclei. The mass difference appears as energy. The nuclear fusion never occurs at room temperature unlike nuclear fission. It is because when two light nuclei come closer to combine, they is strongly repelled by the coulomb repulsive force.

To overcome this repulsion, the two light nuclei must have enough kinetic energy to move closer to each other such that the nuclear force becomes effective. This can be achieved if the temperature is very much greater than 107 K. When the surrounding temperature reaches around 107K, lighter nuclei start fusing to form heavier nuclei and this resulting reaction is called thermonuclear fusion reaction.

**Energy generation in stars:**

The natural place where nuclear fusion occurs is the core of the stars, since their temperature is of the order of 107K. In fact, the energy generation in every star is only through thermonuclear fusion. In most of the stars including our Sun hydrogen atoms fuse into helium and in some stars helium atoms fuse into heavier elements.

The early stage of a star is in the form of cloud and dust. Due to their own gravitational pull, these clouds fall inward. As a result, its gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and finally

**9.8**  

into heat. When the temperature is high enough to initiate the thermonuclear fusion, they start to release enormous energy which tends to stabilize the star and prevents it from further collapse.

The sun’s interior temperature is around 1 5 10

7 . × _K_ . In sun, 6 10

11× _kg_ of hydrogen is converted into helium every second and sun has enough hydrogen such that these fusion reactions last for another 5 billion years. When the hydrogen is burnt out, the sun will enter into new phase called red giant where helium will fuse to become carbon. During this stage, sun will expand greatly in size and all its planets will be engulfed in it.

According to Hans Bethe, the sun is powered by **proton-proton cycle** of fusion reaction. This cycle consists of three steps and the first two steps are as follows:

1 1

1 1

1 2_H H H e_\+ → + ++ ν (9.44)

1 1

1 2

2 3_H H He_\+ → + γ (9.45)

A number of reactions are possible in the third step. But the most dominant one is

2 3

2 3

2 4

1 1

1 1_He He He H H_\+ → + + (9.46)

The overall energy produced in the above reactions is about 27 MeV. The radiation energy we receive from the sun is due to these fusion reactions.

**Elementary particles:**

An atom has a nucleus surrounded by electrons and the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Till 1960s, it was thought that protons, neutrons and electrons are fundamental building blocks of matter. In 1964, physicists Murray Gellman and




  

George Zweig theoretically proposed that protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles; in fact they are made up of quarks. These quarks are now considered elementary particles of nature. Electrons are fundamental or elementary particles because they are not made up of anything. In the year 1968, the quarks were discovered experimentally by Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC), USA. There are six quarks namely, up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom and their antiparticles. All these quarks have fractional charges. For example, charge of

up quark is + 2

3 _e_ and that of down quark is

− 1

3 _e_ .

According to quark model, proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark and neutron is made up of one up quark and two down quarks as shown in the Figure 9.30.

The study of elementary particles is called particle physics and it is an active area of research even now. Till date, more than 20 Nobel prizes have been awarded in the field of particle physics.

**Fundamental forces of nature:** It is known that there exists gravitational

force between two masses and it is universal  

in nature. Our planets are bound to the sun through gravitational force of the sun. In +2 volume 1, we have learnt that between two charges there exists electromagnetic force and it plays major role in most of our day-to- day events. In this unit, we have learnt that between two nucleons, there exists a strong nuclear force and this force is responsible for stability of the nucleus. In addition to these three forces, there exists another fundamental force of nature called the weak force. This weak force is even shorter in range than nuclear force. This force plays an important role in beta decay and energy production of stars. During the fusion of hydrogen into helium in sun, neutrinos and enormous radiations are produced through weak force. The detailed mechanism of weak force is beyond the scope of this book and for further reading, appropriate books can be referred.

Gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak forces are called fundamental forces of nature. It is very interesting to realize that, even for our day-to-day life, we require these four fundamental forces. To put it in simple words: We live on Earth because of Earth’s gravitational attraction on our body. We are standing on the surface of the Earth because of the electromagnetic force between atoms of the surface of the Earth and atoms in our foot. The atoms in our body are stable because of strong nuclear force. Finally, the lives of species on earth depend on the solar energy from the sun and it is due to weak force which plays vital role during nuclear fusion reactions going on in the core of the sun.

**INTRODUCTION**

Electronics has become a part of our daily life. All gadgets like mobile phones, computers, televisions, music systems etc work on the electronic principles. Electronic circuits are used to perform various operations in devices like air conditioners, microwave oven, dish washers and washing machines. Besides this, its applications are widespread in all fields like communication systems, medical diagnosis and treatments and even handling money through ATMs.

_Electronics is clearly the winner of the day_ – John Ford.

**Evolution of Electronics:** The history of electronics began with the

invention of vacuum diode by J.A. Fleming in 1897. This was followed by a vacuum triode implemented by Lee De Forest to control electrical signals. This led to the introduction of tetrode and pentode tubes.

Subsequently, the transistor era began with the invention of bipolar junction transistor by Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley in 1948 for which they received Nobel prize in 1956. The emergence of germanium and silicon semiconductor materials made this transistor gain popularity, in turn its application in different electronic circuits.




  

The following years witnessed the invention of the integrated circuits (ICs) that helped to integrate the entire electronic circuit on a single chip which is small in size and cost-effective. Since 1958 ICs capable of holding several thousand electronic components on a single chip such as small- scale, medium-scale, large-scale, and very- large scale integration started coming into existence. Digital integrated circuits became another robust IC development that enhanced the architecture of computers. All these radical changes led to the introduction of microprocessor in 1969 by Intel.

The electronics revolution, in due course of time, accelerated the computer revolution. Now the world is on its way towards small particles of nano-size, far too small to see. This helps in the miniaturization to an unimaginable size. A room-size computer during its invention has now emerged as a laptop, palmtop, iPad, etc. In the recent past, IBM has released the smallest computer whose size is comparable to the tip of the rice grain, measuring just 0.33 mm on each side.

Electronics is the branch of physics which incorporates technology to design electrical circuits using transistors and microchips. It depicts the behaviour and movement of electrons and holes in a semiconductor, electrons and ions in vacuum or gas. Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active components such as transistors, diodes, integrated circuits and sensors, associated with the passive components like resistors, inductors, capacitors and transformers.

This chapter deals with semiconductor devices like _p-n_ junction diodes, bipolar junction transistors and logic circuits.  

**Passive components:** components that cannot generate power in a circuit.

The world’s first computer ‘ENIAC’ was invented by J. Presper Eckert and

John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania. The construction work started in 1943 and got over in 1946. It occupied an area of around 1800 square feet. It had 18,000 vacuum tubes and it weighed around 50 tons.




  

**10.1.1 Energy band diagram of solids**

In an isolated atom, the electronic energy levels are widely separated and are far apart and the energy of the electron is decided by the orbit in which it revolves around the nucleus. However, in the case of a solid, the atoms are closely spaced and hence the electrons in the outermost energy levels of nearby atoms influence each other. This changes the nature of the electron motion in a solid from that in an isolated atom to a large extent.

The valence electrons in an atom are responsible for the bonding nature. Let us consider an atom with one electron in the outermost orbit. It means that the number of valence electrons is one. When two such atoms are brought close to each other, the valence orbitals are split up into two. Similarly the unoccupied orbitals of each atom will also split up into two. The electrons have the choice of choosing any one of the orbitals as the energy of both the orbitals is the same. When the third atom of the same element is brought to this system, the valence orbitals of all the three atoms are split into three.The unoccupied orbitals also will split into three.

In reality, a solid is made up of millions of atoms. When millions of atoms are brought close to each other, the valence orbitals and the unoccupied orbitals are split according to the number of atoms. In this case, the

energy levels will be closely spaced and will be difficult to differentiate the orbitals of one atom from the other and they look like a band as shown in Figure 10.2. **This band of very large number of closely spaced energy levels in a very small energy range is known as energy band.**

The energy band formed due to the valence orbitals is called **valence band (VB)** and that formed due to the unoccupied orbitals to which electrons can jump when energised is called the **conduction band (CB).** The energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band is called **forbidden energy gap (_Eg_).** Electrons cannot exist in the forbidden energy gap.

A simple pictorial representation of the valence band and conduction band is shown in Figure 10.2(a). _EV_ represents the maximum energy of the valence band and _EC_ represents minimum energy of the conduction band. The forbidden energy gap, _Eg_ = _EC_– _Ev_. We know that the Coulomb force of attraction between the orbiting electron and the nucleus is inversely proportional to the distance between them. Therefore, the electrons in the orbitals closer to the nucleus are strongly bound to it. Hence, the electrons closer to nucleus require a lot of energy to be excited. The electrons in the valence band are loosely bound to the nucleus and can be easily excited to become free electrons.

**Note**

**10.1.2 Classification of materials**

The classification of solids into insulators, metals, and semiconductors can be explained with the help of the energy band diagram.

**i) Insulators** The energy band structure of insulators

is shown in Figure 10.2(b). The valence band and the conduction band are separated by a large energy gap. The forbidden energy gap is approximately 6 eV in insulators. The gap is very large that electrons from valence band cannot move into conduction band even on the application of strong external electric field or the increase in temperature. Therefore, the electrical conduction is not possible as the free electrons are not available for conduction and hence these materials are called insulators. Its resistivity is in the range of 1011–1019 Ωm.

**ii) Conductors** In condutors, the valence band and

conduction band overlap as shown in Figure 10.2(c). Hence, electrons can move freely into the conduction band which results in a large number of free electrons available in the conduction band. Therefore, conduction becomes possible even at low temperatures. The application of electric field provides sufficient energy to the electrons to drift in a particular direction to constitute a current. For condutors, the resistivity value lies between 10–2 Ωm and 10–8 Ωm.

**iii) Semiconductors** In semiconductors, there exists a narrow

forbidden energy gap _E eVg_ <( )3 between the valence band and the conduction band  

(Figure 10.2(d)). At a finite temperature, thermal agitations in the solid can break the covalent bond between the atoms (covalent bond is formed due to the sharing of electrons to attain stable electronic configuration). This releases some electrons from valence band to conduction band. Since free electrons are small in number, the conductivity of the semiconductors is not as high as that of the conductors. The resistivity value of semiconductors is from 10–5 Ωm to 106 Ωm.

In semiconductors, electrons in the valence band are bound electrons which cannot move.

Hence, they cannot contribute for conduction.

**Note**

When the temperature is increased further, more number of electrons are promoted to the conduction band and they increase the conduction. Thus, we can say that the electrical conduction increases with the increase in temperature. In other words, resistance decreases with increase in temperature. Hence, semiconductors are said to have negative temperature coefficient of resistance. The most important commonly used elemental semiconducting materials are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The values of forbidden energy gap for Si and Ge at room temperature are 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV respectively.

presence of any other foreign atom in the crystal lattice. The silicon lattice is shown in Figure 10.3(a). Each silicon atom has four electrons in the outermost orbit and is covalently bonded with four neighbouring atoms to form the lattice. The band diagram for this case is shown in Figure 10.3(b).

A small increase in temperature is sufficient enough to break some of the covalent bonds and release the electrons free from the lattice (10.4(a)). As a result, some states in the valence band become empty and the same number of states in the conduction band will be occupied by

electrons as shown in Figure 10.4(b). The vacancies produced in the valence band are called holes. As the holes are deficiency of electrons, they are treated to possess positive charges. Hence, electrons and holes are the two charge carriers in semiconductors.

In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band. The electrical conduction is due to the electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The corresponding currents are represented as _Ie_ and _Ih_ respectively.

Definition of a hole: When an electron is excited, covalent bond is broken. Now octet rule

will not be satisfied. Thus each excited electron leaves a vacancy to complete bonding. This ‘deficiency’ of electron is termed as a ‘hole’

**Note**

The total current _I_ is always the sum of the electron current and the hole current. That is, _I I Ie h_\= + .

An intrinsic semiconductor behaves like an insulator at 0 K. The increase in temperature increases the number of charge carriers (electrons and holes). The schematic diagram of the intrinsic semiconductor in band diagram is shown in Figure 10.4(b). **The intrinsic carrier concentration is the number of electrons in the conduction band or the number of holes in the valence band in an intrinsic semiconductor**.

**10.2.2 Extrinsic semiconductors** The carrier concentration in an

intrinsic semiconductor is not sufficient enough to develop efficient electronic devices. Another way of increasing the carrier concentration in an intrinsic semiconductor is by adding impurity atoms.

**The process of adding impurities to the intrinsic semiconductor is called doping.** It increases the concentration of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in the semiconductor and in turn, its electrical conductivity. The impurity atoms are called dopants and its order is approximately 100 ppm (parts per million).

On the basis of the type of impurity added, extrinsic semiconductors are classified into:  

i) _n_\-type semiconductor ii) _p_\-type semiconductor

**i) _n_\-type semiconductor** A _n_\-type semiconductor is obtained

by doping a pure silicon (or germanium) crystal with pentavalent impurity atoms (from V group of periodic table) such as phosphorus, arsenic and antimony as shown in Figure 10.5(a). The dopant has five valence electrons while the silicon atom has four valence electrons. During the process of doping, a few of the silicon atoms are replaced by pentavalent

dopants. Four of the five valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bonds with four silicon atoms. The fifth valence electron of the impurity atom is loosely attached with the nucleus as it is not used in the formation of the covalent bond.

The energy level of the loosely attached fifth electron from the dopant is found just below the conduction band edge and is called the donor energy level as shown in Figure 10.5(b). At room temperature, these electrons can easily move to the conduction band with the absorption of thermal energy. It is shown in the Figure 10.6. Besides, an external electric field also can set free the loosely bound electrons and lead to conduction.

**Figure 10.6** Thermally generated holes in the valence band and the free electrons generated by the dopants in the conduction band (_n_\-type semiconductor)

It is important to note that the energy required for an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band in an intrinsic semiconductor is 0.7 eV for Ge and 1.1 eV for Si, while the energy required to set free a donor electron is only 0.01 eV for Ge and 0.05 eV for Si.

The V group pentavalent impurity atoms donate electrons to the conduction band and are called donor impurities. Therefore,  

each impurity atom provides one extra electron to the conduction band in addition to the thermally generated electrons. These thermally generated electrons leave holes in valence band. Hence, the majority carriers of current in an _n_\-type semiconductor are electrons and the minority carriers are holes. Such a semiconductor doped with a pentavalent impurity is called an _n_\-type semiconductor.

**ii) _p_\-type semiconductor** In _p_\-type semiconductor, trivalent impurity

atoms (from III group of periodic table) such as boron, aluminium, gallium and indium are added to the silicon (or germanium) crystal. The dopant with three valence electrons can form three covalent bonds with three silicon atoms. Of the four covalent bonds, three bonds are complete and the remaining one bond is incomplete with one electron. This electron vacancy present in the fourth covalent bond is represented as a hole.

To make complete covalent bonding with all four neighbouring atoms, the dopant is in need of one more electron. These dopants can accept electrons from the neighbouring atoms. Therefore, this impurity is called an acceptor impurity. The energy level of the hole created by each impurity atom is just above the valence band and is called the acceptor energy level, as shown in Figure 10.7(b).

For each acceptor atom, there will be a hole in the valence band; this is in addition to the holes left by the thermally generated electrons. In such an extrinsic semiconductor, holes are the majority carriers and thermally generated electrons are minority carriers as shown in Figure 10.8. The extrinsic semiconductor thus formed is called a _p_\-type semiconductor.

doped to the intrinsic semiconductors.

**DIODES**

**10.3.1 P-N Junction formation**

**i) Formation of depletion layer** A single piece of semiconductor crystal

is suitably doped such that its one side is _p_\-type semiconductor and the other side is _n_\-type semiconductor. The contact surface between the two sides is called _p-n_ junction. Whenever _p-n_ junction is formed, some of the free electrons diffuse from the _n_\-side to the _p_\-side while the holes from the _p_\-side to the _n_\-side. The diffusion of charge carriers happens due to the fact that the _n_\-side has higher electron concentration and the _p_\-side has higher hole concentration. **The diffusion of the majority charge carriers across the junction gives rise to an electric current, called diffusion current**.

When an electron leaves the _n_\-side, a pentavalent atom in the _n_\-side becomes a positive ion. The free electron migrating into _p_\-side recombines with a hole present in a trivalent atom near the junction and the trivalent atom becomes a negative ion. Since such ions are bonded to the neighbouring atoms in the crystal lattice, they are unable to move. As the diffusion process continues, a layer of positive ions and a layer of negative ions are created on either side of the junction accordingly. **The thin region near**

**10.3**




  

**the junction which is free from charge carriers (free electrons and holes) is called depletion region** (Figure 10.9).

An electric field is set up between the positively charged layer in the _n_\-side and the negatively charged layer in the _p_\-side in the depletion region as shown in the Figure 10.9. This electric field makes electrons in the _p_\-side drift into the _n_\-side and the holes in the _n_\-side into the _p_\-side. **The electric current produced due to the motion of the minority charge carriers by the electric field is known as drift current**. The diffusion current and drift current flow in opposite directions.

Though drift current is less than diffusion current initially, equilibrium is reached between them at a particular time. With each electron (or hole) diffusing across the junction, the strength of the electric field increases thereby increasing the drift current till the two currents become equal. Hence at equilibrium,

there is no net electric current across the junction. Thus, a _p-n_ junction is formed.

**ii) Junction potential or barrier potential** The movement of charge carriers across

the junction takes place only to a certain point beyond which the depletion layer acts like a barrier to further diffusion of free charges across the junction. This is due to the fact that the immobile ions on both sides establish an electric potential difference across the junction.

**10.3.2 P-N Junction diode**

**A _p-n_ junction diode is formed when a _p_\-type semiconductor is fused with an _n_\-type semiconductor**. It is a device with single _p-n_ junction as shown in Figure 10.11(a) and its circuit symbol is shown in Figure 10.11(b).

**Biasing a diode Biasing means providing external**

**energy to charge carriers to overcome the barrier potential and make them move in a particular direction.** The charge carriers can either move towards the junction or away from the junction. **The external voltage applied to the _p-n_ junction is called bias voltage**. Depending on the polarity of the external source to the _p-n_ junction, we have two types of biasing:

i) Forward bias ii) Reverse bias

**i) Forward bias** If the positive terminal of the external

voltage source is connected to the _p_\-side and the negative terminal to the _n_\-side, it is called forward bias as shown in Figure 10.12. The application of a forward bias potential pushes electrons in the _n_\-side and the holes in the _p_\-side towards the junction. This initiates the recombination with the ions near the junction which in turn reduces the width of the depletion region and hence the barrier potential.

The electron from the _n_\-side is now accelerated towards the _p_\-side as it experiences a reduced barrier potential at  

the junction. In addition, the accelerated electrons experience a strong attraction by the positive potential applied to the _p_\-side. This results in the movement of electrons in the _n_\-side towards the _p_\-side and similarly, holes in the _p_\-side towards the _n_\-side. When the applied voltage is increased, the width of the depletion region and hence the barrier potential are further reduced. This results in a large number of electrons passing through the junction resulting in an exponential rise in current through the junction.

terminal and the holes in the _p_\-side are attracted by the negative terminal. This increases the immobile ion concentration at the junction. The net effect is the widening of the depletion region leading to an increase in the barrier potential. Consequently, the majority charge carriers from both sides experience a great potential barrier to cross the junction. This reduces the diffusion current across the junction drastically.

Yet, a small current flows across the junction due to the minority charge carriers in both regions. The reverse bias for majority charge carriers serves as the forward bias for minority charge carriers. The current that flows under a reverse bias is called the reverse saturation current**.** It is represented as _I_s.

The reverse saturation current is independent of the applied voltage and it depends only on the concentration of the thermally generated minority charge carriers. Even a small voltage is sufficient enough to drive the minority charge carriers across the junction.

The reverse saturation current of a silicon diode doubles for every 10 °C rise in temperature.

**Note**

**10.3.3 Characteristics of a junction diode**

**i) Forward characteristics** It is the study of the variation in current

through the diode with respect to the applied voltage across the diode when it is forward biased.

The _p-n_ junction diode is forward biased as shown in Figure 10.14(a). An external resistance (_R_) is used to limit the flow of  

current through the diode. The voltage across the diode is varied by varying the biasing voltage across the DC power supply. The forward bias voltage and the corresponding forward bias current are noted. A graph is plotted by taking the forward bias voltage (_VF_) along the x-axis and the current (_IF_) through the diode along the y-axis. This graph is called the **forward V-I characteristics** of the _p-n_ junction diode and is shown in Figure 10.14(b). Four inferences can be brought out from the graph:

(i) At room temperature, a potential difference equal to the barrier potential is required before a reasonable forward current starts flowing across the diode. This voltage is known as **threshold voltage or cut-in voltage or knee voltage** (_Vknee_). It




  

is approximately 0.3 V for germanium and 0.7 V for silicon. The current flow is negligible when the applied voltage is less than the threshold voltage. Beyond the threshold voltage, increase in current is significant even for a small increase in voltage.

(ii) The graph clearly infers that the current flow is not linear and is exponential. Hence it does not obey Ohm’s law.

(iii) The forward resistance (_r_F) of the diode is the ratio of the small change in voltage ∆_V_F( ) to the small change in current

∆_I_F( ) . That is, _r V I_F

F

F

\= ∆ ∆ .

(iv) Thus the diode behaves as a conductor when it is forward biased.

However, if the applied voltage is increased beyond a rated value, it will produce an extremely large current which may destroy the junction due to overheating. This is called as the breakdown of the diode and the voltage at which the diode breaks down is called the breakdown voltage. Thus, it is safe to operate a diode between the threshold voltage and the breakdown voltage.

**ii) Reverse characteristics** The circuit to study the reverse

characteristics is shown in Figure 10.15(a). In the reverse bias, the _p_\-side of the diode is connected to the negative terminal and _n_\-side to the positive terminal of the dc power supply.

A graph drawn between the reverse bias voltage and the current across the junction is called the reverse characteristics of a _p-n_ junction diode. It is shown in Figure 10.15(b). Under this bias, a very small

current in µA flows across the junction. This is due to the flow of the minority charge carriers and is called **t**he leakage current or reverse saturation current. This reverse current is independent of the voltage up to a certain voltage, known as breakdown voltage.

Ideal diode: It acts like a conductor when it is forward biased. When it is reverse

biased, it acts like an insulator. For ideal diodes, the forward resistance is zero and barrier potential is considered negligible.

**Note**

The forward and reverse charactristics are given in one graph as shown in Figure 10.16.

**10.3.4 Rectification**

**The process in which alternating voltage or alternating current is converted into direct voltage or direct current is known as rectification**. The device used for this process is called as rectifier. In this section, we will discuss two types of rectifiers namely, half wave rectifier and full wave rectifier

**i) Half wave rectifier circuit** The half wave rectifier circuit consists

of a transformer, a _p-n_ junction diode and a resistor (Figure 10.17(a)). In a half wave rectifier circuit, either a positive half or the negative half of the AC input is passed through by the diode while the other half is blocked. Only one half of the input wave is rectified. Therefore, it is called half wave rectifier. Here, a _p-n_ junction diode acts as a rectifier diode.

_During the positive half cycle_ When the positive half cycle of the AC

input signal passes through the circuit,

terminal _A_ becomes positive with respect to terminal _B_. The diode is forward biased and hence it conducts. The current flows through the load resistor _R_L and the AC voltage developed across _R_L constitutes the output voltage _V_0 and the waveform of the output voltage is shown in Figure 10.17(b).

_During the negative half cycle_ When the negative half cycle of the AC

input signal passes through the circuit, terminal _A_ is negative with respect to terminal _B_. Now the diode is reverse biased and does not conduct. Hence no current passes through _R_L. The reverse saturation current in a diode is negligible. Since there is no voltage drop across _R_L, the negative half cycle of AC supply is suppressed at the output.

The output of the half wave rectifier is not a steady DC voltage but a pulsating wave. This pulsating voltage cannot be used for electronic equipments. A constant or a steady voltage is required which can be obtained with the help of filter circuits and voltage regulator circuits.

**Efficiency (η) is the ratio of the output DC power to the AC input power supplied to the circuit**. Its value for half wave rectifier is 40.6 %.

If the direction of the diode is reversed, the negative half of the AC signal is passed

through and the positive half is blocked.

**Note**

**ii) Full wave rectifier** The positive and negative half cycles

of the AC input signal are rectified in this circuit and hence it is called the full wave rectifier. The circuit is shown in Figure 10.18(a). It consists of two _p-n_ junction diodes, a centre tap transformer and a load resistor _RL_. The centre is usually taken as the ground or zero voltage reference point. With the help of the centre tap transformer, each diode rectifies one half of the total secondary voltage.

_During positive half cycle_ When the positive half cycle of the AC

input signal passes through the circuit, terminal _M_ is positive, _C_ is at zero potential and _N_ is at negative potential. This forward biases diode _D_1 and reverse biases diode _D_2\. Hence, being forward biased, diode _D_1 conducts and current flows along the path _MD ABC_1 .

_During negative half cycle_ When the negative half cycle of the AC

input signal passes through the circuit, terminal _N_ becomes positive, _C_ is at zero







  

potential and _M_ is at negative potential. This forward biases diode _D_2 and reverse biases diode _D_1\. Hence, being forward biased, diode _D_2 conducts and current flows along the path _ND ABC_2 .

During both postive and negative half cycles of the input signal, the current flows through the load in the same direction. The output signal corresponding to the input signal is shown in Figure 10.18(b). Though both half cycles of AC input are rectified, the output is still pulsating in nature.

The efficiency (η) of full wave rectifier is twice that of a half wave rectifier and is found to be 81.2 %. It is because of power losses in the winding, the diode and the load resistance.

**Centre tap transformer**: There is a facility to tap at halfway point in the

secondary windings. This helps to measure the induced voltage from one end of the secondary to the centre point. If the centre tap point is grounded, then the voltage across the secondary will be divided into two halves. For example, if the voltage across the secondary is 240 V, then the voltage across one end and the centre tap point is +120 V and at the other end it is –120 V.

**Note**

**10.3.5 Breakdown mechanism**

The reverse current or the reverse saturation current due to the minority charge carriers is small. If the reverse bias applied to a _p-n_ junction is increased beyond a point, the junction breaks down and the reverse current rises sharply. The voltage at which breakdown happens is called the breakdown voltage and it depends on the width of the depletion region, which in turn depends on the doping level.

A normal _p-n_ junction diode gets damaged at this point. Specially designed diodes like Zener diode can be operated at this region and can be used for the purpose of voltage regulation in circuits. There are two mechanisms that are responsible for breakdown under increasing reverse voltage.

**i) Avalanche breakdown** Avalanche breakdown occurs in a lightly

doped junctions which have wide depletion region. When reverse bias voltage exceeds a certain value, the minority charge carriers are accelerated by reverse voltage and their kinetic energy increases. These charge carriers collide







|------|------|
| D1D2 |




  

with semiconductor atoms while passing through the depletion region. This leads to the breaking up of covalent bonds and this results in the generation of electron - hole pairs.

The newly generated charge carriers are also accelerated by the reverse voltage resulting in more collisions and further production of charge carriers. This cumulative process leads to an avalanche (uncontrollably large number) of charge carriers across the junction. This causes diode current to rise abruptly and breakdown takes place. This breakdown is called avalanche breakdown.

**ii) Zener breakdown** Heavily doped _p-n_ junctions have narrow

depletion layers whose width is of the order of <10–6 m. When reverse voltage across this junction is increased to the breakdown limit, a very strong electric field of strength 3 × 107 V m–1 is set up across the narrow layer. This electric field is strong enough to break or rupture the covalent bonds in the lattice and thereby generating electron-hole pairs. This effect is called **Zener effect**.

Even a small further increase in reverse voltage produces a large number of charge carriers which move across the junction through the thin depletion region. This process gives rise to a large amount reverse current or breakdown current and this breakdown is called Zener breakdown.

In Avalanche breakdown, the minority charge carriers gain sufficient energy from excessive reverse bias voltage to

break covalent bond in order to produce new charge carriers. But Zener breakdown occurs due to the direct rupture of covalent bonds because of the existence of the strong electric field. Since depletion region is thin, Zener breakdown occurs usually at lesser reverse bias voltage compared to Avalanche breakdown voltage.

**Note**  

**10.3.6 Zener diode**

Zener diode is a heavily doped silicon diode used in reverse biased condition and is named after its inventor Clarence Melvin Zener. It is specially designed to be operated in the breakdown region. The doping level of the silicon diode can be varied to have a wide range of breakdown voltages from 2 V to over 1000 V.

As explained in the previous section, Zener breakdown occurs due to the breaking up of covalent bonds by the strong electric field set up in the depletion region by the reverse voltage. It produces an extremely large number of electrons and holes which constitute the reverse saturation current. The current is limited by both external resistance and power dissipation of the diode. A Zener diode is shown in Figure 10.19(a) and its circuit symbol is given in Figure 10.19(b).

It looks like an ordinary _p-n_ junction diode except that _n_\-side lead resembles the shape of the letter ‘z’. The arrow head points the direction of conventional current. In Figure 10.19(a), black ring indicates the _n_\-side lead.

**V-I Characteristics of Zener diode** The circuit to study the forward and reverse

characteristics of a Zener diode is shown in Figure 10.20(a) and Figure 10.20 (b). The V-I characteristics of a Zener diode is shown in Figure 10.20(c). The forward characteristic of a Zener diode is similar to that of an ordinary _p-n_ junction diode. It starts conducting approximately around 0.7 V. However, the reverse characteristics is highly significant in Zener diode. The increase in reverse voltage




  

normally generates very small reverse current. While in Zener diode, when the reverse voltage is increased to the breakdown voltage (_V_Z), the increase in current is very sharp. The voltage remains almost constant throughout the breakdown region. In Figure 10.20(c), _I_Z(max) represents the maximum reverse current. If the reverse current is increased further, the diode will be damaged.

• Maximum current limited by maximum power dissipation, _IZ_ max( ) →

The Zener diode is operated in the reverse bias condition with the voltage greater than _V_Z and current less than _I_Z(max). The reverse characteristic is not exactly vertical which means that the diode possesses some small resistance called Zener dynamic impedance. Zener resistance is the inverse of the slope of the curve in the breakdown region. It means an increase in the Zener current produces only a very small increase in the reverse voltage. However this can be neglected. The voltage of an ideal Zener diode does not change once it goes into breakdown. In other words, **_V_Z remains almost constant even when _I_Z increases considerably**.

The maximum reverse bias that can be applied before entering into the Zener

region is called the peak inverse voltage, commercially referred as PIV rating.

**Note**

**Applications** The zener diode can be used

• as voltage regulator • for calibrating voltages • to provide fixed reference voltage in a

network for biasing • to protect of any gadget against damage

from accidental application of excessive voltage.

**Zener diode as a voltage regulator** Zener diode working in the breakdown

region can serve as a voltage regulator whose circuit diagram is given in Figure 10.21. A series resistance _R_s of suitable value is used to limit the Zener current to avoid any damage to the diode. This resistance also plays a role in voltage regulation. The fluctuating DC

input voltage is applied to the circuit and constant output voltage _V_o is taken across the load resistance _R_L which is connected in parallel with Zener diode. The output voltage is maintained constant as long as the input voltage is greater than _VZ_ .

If the input DC voltage is increased, the Zener current increases thereby increasing current through _R_s and the voltage drop across _R_s is also increased. The increased current flows through the diode without affecting the _I_L. Since Zener diode is operated in the breakdown region, the Zener breakdown voltage across the diode is nearly constant even though the reverse bias current through the diode increases considerably. The increase in input voltage is dropped across _R_s and hence it is also called dropping resistance. Because of the parallel connection, the voltage across _R_L is also equal to Zener breakdown voltage which is taken as constant output voltage _V_0.

If the input DC voltage is decreased, the diode takes a smaller current and the voltage drop across _R_s is reduced. Thus, the output voltage _V_0 remains constant. To sum up, if there is any change in input voltage, the voltage drop across _R_s changes accordingly. But the voltage across Zener diode or voltage across _R_L remains constant. Thus the Zener diode acts as a voltage regulator.

**10.3.7 Optoelectronic devices**

Optoelectronics deals with devices which convert electrical energy into light and light into electrical energy using semiconductors. Optoelectronic device is an electronic device which utilizes light for useful applications. We will discuss some important optoelectronic devices namely, light emitting diodes, photo diodes and solar cells.

emits visible or invisible light when it is

forward biased. Since electrical energy is converted into light energy, this process is also called electroluminescence. The circuit symbol of LED is shown in Figure 10.22(a). The direction of arrows indicates that light is emitted from the diode.

**Figure 10.22** (a) Circuit symbol of LED (b) Schematic diagram to explain recombination process

When the _p-n_ junction is forward biased, the conduction band electrons on _n_\-side and valence band holes on _p_\-side diffuse across the junction. When they cross the junction, they become excess minority carriers (electrons in _p_\-side and holes in _n_\-side). These excess minority carriers recombine with oppositely charged majority carriers in the respective regions, i.e. **the electrons in the conduction band recombine with holes in the valence band** as shown in the Figure 10.22(b).

During recombination process, energy is released in the form of light (radiative) or heat (non-radiative). For radiative recombination, a photon of energy _hv_ is emitted. For non-radiative recombination, energy is liberated in the form of heat.  

The colour of the light is determined by the energy band gap of the material. Therefore, LEDs are available in a wide range of colours such as blue (SiC), green (AlGaP) and red (GaAsP). Now a days, LED which emits white light (GaInN) is also available.

**Applications** The light emitting diodes are used in

· indicator lamps on the front panel of the scientific and laboratory equipments.

· seven-segment displays. · traffic signals, emergency vehicle lighting

etc. · remote control of television, air-

conditioner etc.

**EXAMPLE 10.4**

of photodiode is exactly inverse to that of an LED. Photodiode works in reverse bias condition. Its circuit symbol is shown in Figure 10.23(a). The direction of arrows indicates that the light is incident on the photodiode.

The device consists of a _p-n_ junction semiconductor made of photosensitive material kept safely inside a plastic case as shown in Figure 10.23(b). It has a small transparent window that allows light to be incident on the _p-n_ junction. Photodiodes can generate current when the _p-n_ junction is exposed to light and hence are called as light sensors. **(a)**

**_p n_**

**(b)**

**Figure 10.23** (a) Circuit symbol (b) Schematic view of photodiode

When a photon of sufficient energy (_hv_) strikes the depletion region of the diode, some of the valence band electrons are elevated into conduction band, in turn holes are developed in the valence band. This creates electron-hole pairs. The amount of electron-hole pairs generated depends on the intensity of light incident on the _p-n_ junction.

These electrons and holes are swept across the _p-n_ junction by the electric field created by reverse voltage before recombination takes place. Thus, holes move towards the _p_\-side and electrons towards the _n_\-side. When the external circuit is made, the electrons flow through the external circuit and constitute the photocurrent.

When there is no incident light, there exists a reverse current which is negligible.  

This reverse current in the absence of any incident light is called dark current and is due to the thermally generated minority carriers.

**Applications** The photodiodes are used in

· alarm system · count items on a conveyor belt · photoconductors · compact disc players, smoke detectors · medical applications such as detectors for

computed tomography etc.

**iii) Solar cell** A solar cell, also known as photovoltaic

cell, works on the principle of **photovoltaic effect**. Accordingly, the _p-n_ junction of the solar cell generates emf when solar radiation falls on it. The construction details and cross-sectional view are shown in Figure 10.24.

In a solar cell, electron–hole pairs are generated due to the absorption of light photons near the junction. Then the charge carriers are separated due to the electric field of the depletion region. Electrons move towards _n_–type silicon layer and holes move towards _p_\-type silicon layer. The electrons reaching the _n_\-side are collected by the front contact (metal finger contact) and holes reaching _p_\-side are collected by the back

Many solar cells are connected together either in series or in parallel combination to form a solar panel. Many solar panels are connected with each other to form solar arrays. For high power applications, solar panels and solar arrays are used.

**Applications:** i) Solar cells are widely used in

calculators, watches, toys, portable power supplies, etc.

**THE BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR \[BJT\]**

**Introduction** In 1951, William Schockley invented

the modern version of transistor. It is a semiconductor device that led to a technological revolution in the twentieth century. The heat loss in transistor is very less. This has laid the foundation for integrated chips which contain thousands of miniaturized transistors. The emergence of the integrated chips led to increasing applications in the fast developing electronics industry.

**Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)** The BJT consists of a semiconductor

(silicon or germanium) crystal in which an _n_\-type material is sandwiched between two _p_\-type materials (PNP transistor) or

**10.4**  

a _p_\-type material sandwiched between two _n_\-type materials (NPN transistor). To protect it against moisture, it is sealed inside a metal or a plastic case. The two types of transistors with their circuit symbols are shown in Figure 10.25.

The three regions formed are called as emitter, base and collector which are provided with terminals or ohmic contacts labeled as _E, B_, and _C_. As BJT has two _p-n_ junctions, two depletion layers are formed across the emitter-base junction (JEB) and collector-base junction (JCB) respectively. The circuit symbol carries an arrowhead at the emitter lead pointing from _p_ to _n_ indicating the direction of conventional current.

_Emitter_: The main function of the emitter is

to supply majority charge carriers to the collector region through the base region. Hence, emitter is more heavily doped than the other two regions.










  

_Base:_ Base is very thin (10–6 m) and very lightly

doped region when compared to the other two regions.

_Collector:_ The main function of collector is to

collect the majority charge carriers supplied by the emitter through the base. Hence, collector is made physically larger than the other two as it has to dissipate more power. It is modarately doped.

Because of the differing size and the amount of doping, the emitter and collector

cannot be interchanged.

**Note**

**Transistor Biasing** The application of suitable DC voltages

across the transistor terminals is called biasing. The transistor biasing is done differently for different uses. The different modes of transistor biasing are given below.

_Forward Active:_ In this bias, the emitter-base junction

is forward biased and the collector-base junction is reverse biased. The transistor is in the active mode of operation. In this mode, the transistor functions as an amplifier.

_Saturation:_ Here, the emitter-base junction and

collector-base junction are forward biased. The transistor has a very large flow of currents across the junctions. In this mode, transistor is used as a closed switch.

_Cut-off:_ In this bias, the emitter-base junction and

collector-base junction are reverse biased. Transistor in this mode acts an open switch.  

In a PNP transistor, base and collector will be negative with respect to emitter indicated

by the middle letter N whereas base and collector will be positive in an NPN transistor indicated by the middle letter P.

**Note**

**10.4.1 Transistor circuit configurations**

There are three types of circuit connections for operating a transistor based on the terminal that is used in common to both input and output circuits.

**i) Common-Base (CB) configuration** The base is common to both the input

and output circuits. The schematic and circuit symbol are shown in Figure 10.26(a) and 10.26(b). The input current is the emitter current _I_E and the output current is the collector current _I_C. The input signal is applied between emitter and base while the output is measured between collector and base.

As the output is taken from the emitter in common collector configuration, it is

called an emitter follower.

**Figure 10.29** Flow of current in a NPN transistor

Basically, a BJT can be considered as two _p-n_ junction diodes connected back- to-back. In the forward active bias of the




  

transistor, the emitter-base junction is forward biased by a DC power supply _V_EB and the collector-base junction is reverse biased by the bias power supply _V_CB. The forward bias decreases the depletion region across the emitter-base junction and the reverse bias increases the depletion region across the collector-base junction. Hence, the barrier potential across the emitter-base junction is decreased and that across the collector-base junction is increased. The voltage across the emitter- base junction is represented as _V_EB and that across the collector-base junction as _V_CB.

In an NPN transistor, the majority charge carriers in the emitter are electrons. As it is heavily doped, it has a large number of electrons. The forward bias across the emitter-base junction causes the electrons in the emitter region to flow towards the base region and constitutes the emitter current (_I_E). The electrons after reaching the base region recombine with the holes in the base region. Since the base region is very narrow and lightly doped, the number of holes in it is not sufficient to recombine with electrons from emitter. Hence most of the electrons reach the collector region.

Eventually, the electrons that reach the collector region will be attracted by the collector terminal as it has positive potential and flow through the external circuit. This constitutes the collector current (_I_C). The holes that are lost due to recombination in the base region are replaced by the positive potential of the bias voltage _V_BE and constitute the base current (_I_B). The magnitude of the base current will be in microamperes as against  

milliamperes for emitter and collector currents.

It is to be noted that if the emitter current is zero, then the collector current is almost zero. It is therefore imperative that a BJT is called a current controlled device. Applying Kirchoff ’s law, we can write the emitter current as the sum of the collector current and the base current.

_I I IE B C_\= + (10.1)

Since the base current is very small, we can write _I IE C_≈ . There is another component of collector current due to the thermally generated electrons called reverse saturation current, denoted as _ICO_ . This factor is temperature sensitive. Therefore, care must be taken towards the stability of the system at high temperatures.

The ratio of the collector current to the emitter current is called the forward current gain α( ) of a transistor.

α= _I I_

_C_

_E_

(10.2)

The a of a transistor is a measure of the quality of a transistor. Higher the value of a, better is the quality of the transistor. It means that the collector current is closer to the emitter current. The value of a is less than unity and it ranges from 0.95 to 0.99. This indicates that the collector current is 95% to 99% of the emitter current.

**Working of a PNP transistor** The working of a PNP transistor is similar

to that of the NPN transistor except for the




  

fact that the emitter current _IE_ is due to holes and the base current _IB_ is due to electrons. However, the current through the external circuit is due to the flow of electrons.

Then the base-emitter voltage is increased in suitable steps and the corresponding base-current is recorded. A graph is plotted with _V_BE along the x-axis and _I_B along the y-axis.

The following observations are made from the graph. · The curve looks like the forward characteristics of an ordinary _p-n_ junction diode. · There exists a threshold voltage or knee voltage (_V_knee) below which the base current is very small. This value is 0.7 V for silicon and 0.3 V for germanium transistors. Beyond the knee voltage, the base current increases with the increase in base-emitter voltage. · It is also noted that the increase in the collector-emitter voltage decreases the base current. This shifts the curve outward. This is because the increase in collector-emitter voltage increases the width of the depletion region which in turn, reduces the effective base width and thereby the base current.

_Input impedance_ The ratio of the change in base-emitter

voltage ∆_VBE_( ) to the corresponding change in base current ∆_IB_( ) at a constant collector- emitter voltage _VCE_( ) is called the input impedance (_r_i). The input impedance is not constant in the lower region of the curve.

i) _Saturation region_ When _VCE_ is increased above 0 V, the _IC_

increases rapidly and reaches a saturation value at a particular value of _VCE_ , called knee voltage. The initial part of the curve OA (the ohmic region) between the origin 0 and the knee point A is called saturation region. Transistors are always operated above this knee voltage.

ii) _Cut-off region_ A small collector current exists even after

the base current is reduced to zero. This region below the curve for _I_B = 0 is called cut-off region because the main collector current is cut-off.

iii) _Active region_ The central region of the curves is called

active region. In this region, the base-emitter junction remains in the forward biased condition and the collector-emitter junction remains in the reverse biased condition. The transistor in this region can be used for voltage, current and power amplification.

iv) _Breakdown region_ If the collector-emitter voltage is

increased beyond the rated value given by the manufacturer, the collector current increases enormously leading to the junction breakdown of the transistor. This avalanche breakdown can damage the transistor.

_Output impedance_ The ratio of the change in the collector-

emitter voltage ∆_VCE_( ) to the corresponding change in the collector current ∆ _IC_( ) at constant base current (_I_B) is called output impedance (_r_0).

**iii) Current transfer characteristics** This gives the relationship between the

collector current (_I_C) and the base current (_I_B) at constant collector-emitter voltage (_V_CE) and is shown in Figure 10.33. It is seen that a small _I_C flows even when _I_B is zero. This current is called the common emitter leakage current (_I_CEO), which is due to the flow of minority charge carriers.

**10.4.5 Operating Point**

The operating point is a point where the transistor can be operated efficiently. A straight line drawn by joining the points _A_ (_VCC_ , 0) and _B_ (0, _VCC_ / _RC_ ) is called the DC load line. The DC load line superimposed on the output characteristics of a transistor is used to learn the concept of operating point of the transistor as shown in Figure 10.34.

**Figure 10.34** Output characteristics of a transistor in common emitter mode with the DC load line

In Figure 10.34, the points P, Q, R are called Q points or quiescent points  

which determine the operating point or the working point of a transistor. If the operating point is chosen at the middle of the DC load line (point _Q_), the transistor can effectively work as an amplifier. The operating point determines the maximum signal that can be obtained without being distorted.

For a transistor to work as a open switch, the _Q_ point can be chosen at the cut-off region and to work as a closed switch, the _Q_ point can be chosen in the saturation region.

**10.4.6 Transistor as a switch**

A transistor in saturation region acts as a closed switch while in cut-off region; it acts as an open switch. It functions like an electronic switch that helps to turn ON or OFF a given circuit by a small control signal which keeps the transistor either in saturation region or in cut-off region. The circuit is shown in Figure 10.35.

· **When the input is low:** When the input is low (say 0V), the base

current is zero and transistor is not properly forward biased. It is in cut off region. As a result, the collector current is zero and correspondingly the voltage drop across _R_C also becomes nearly zero. The output voltage is high and is equal to _V_CC. It means that the no current flows through the transistor and it is said to be switched off. The transistor acts as an open switch.

· **When the input is high:** When the input voltage is increased to a

certain high value (say +5 V), the base current (_IB_) increases and in turn increases the collector current to its maximum. The transistor will move into the saturation region. The increase in collector current (_IC_) increases the voltage drop across _RC_, thereby lowering the output voltage, close to zero (since _V0_ = _VCC_ – _ICRC_). It means that maximum current flows through the transistor and it is said to be switched on. The transistor acts as a closed switch.

It is manifested that a high input to the transistor gives a low output and a low input gives a high output. In addition, we can say that the output voltage is opposite to the applied input voltage. Therefore, a transistor can be used as an inverter (NOT gate) in computer logic circuitry.

**10.4.7 Transistor as an amplifier**

A transistor operating in the active region has the capability to amplify weak signals. **Amplification is the process of increasing the signal strength (increase in the amplitude).** If a large amplification is required, the transistors are cascaded with coupling elements like resistors, capacitors, and transformers and they are called multistage amplifiers.

Here, the amplification of an electrical signal is explained with a single stage transistor amplifier which is shown in Figure 10.36(a). Single stage indicates that the circuit consists of one transistor with the allied components. An NPN transistor is connected in the common emitter configuration.

**Figure 10.36** (a) Transistor as an amplifier (b) Input and output waveforms showing 1800 phase reversal.

To start with, the _Q_ point or the operating point of the transistor is fixed so as to get the maximum signal swing at the output (neither towards saturation point nor towards cut-off).

A load resistance _RC_ is connected in series with the collector circuit to measure the output voltage. The resistance _R_1, _R_2 and _R_E form the biasing and stabilization circuit. The capacitor _C_1 allows only the AC signal to pass through. The emitter bypass capacitor _C_E provides a low reactance path to the amplified AC signal. The coupling capacitor _C_C is used to couple one stage of the amplifier with the next stage while constructing multistage amplifiers.

_VS_ is the sinusoidal input signal source applied across the base-emitter. The output is taken across the collector-emitter.

**Working of the amplifier** · _During the positive half cycle_

Input signal (_V_S) increases the forward voltage across the emitter-base. As a result, the base current (_I_B in μA) increases. Consequently, the collector current (_I_C in mA) increases β times. This increases the voltage drop across _R_c (_I_c_R_c) which in turn decreases the collector-emitter voltage (_V_CE). Therefore, the input signal during the positive half cycle produces negative half cycle of the amplified signal at the output. Hence, the output signal is reversed by 180° as shown in Figure 10.36(b).

· _During the negative half cycle_ Input signal (_V_S) decreases the forward

voltage across the emitter-base. As a result, base current (_I_B in μA) decreases and in turn decreases the collector current (_I_C in mA). The decrease in collector current (_I_C) decreases the potential drop across _R_C which in turn increases the collector-emitter voltage (_V_CE). Thus, the input signal during the negative half cycle produces positive half cycle of the amplified signal at the output.Therefore, 1800 phase reversal is observed during the negative half cycle of the input signal also as shown in Figure 10.36(b).

**10.4.8 Transistor as an oscillator**

**An electronic oscillator basically converts DC energy into AC energy of frequency ranging from a few Hz to several MHz.** Hence, it is a source of alternating current or voltage. Unlike an amplifier, oscillator does not require any external signal source.

Basically, there are two types of oscillators: **Sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal**. Sinusoidal oscillators generate oscillations in the form of sine waves at constant amplitude and




  

frequency as shown in Figure 10.37(a). Non- sinusoidal oscillators generate complex, non-sinusoidal waveforms like square- wave, triangular-wave and sawtooth-wave as shown in Figure 10.36 (b), (c), (d).

Sinusoidal oscillations are of two types: **Damped and undamped.** If the amplitude of the electrical oscillations decreases with time due to energy loss, it is called damped oscillations as shown in Figure 10.38(a). On the other hand, the amplitude of the electrical oscillations remains constant with time in undamped oscillations as shown in Figure 10.38(b). _v_

**Transistor oscillator** An oscillator circuit consists of three

components. They are i) tank circuit ii) amplifier and iii) feedback network. The block diagram is shown in Figure 10.39(a).  

**i) _Tank circuit_** The _LC_ tank circuit consists of an

inductance _L_ and a capacitor _C_ connected in parallel as shown in Figure 10.39(b). Whenever energy is supplied to the tank circuit from a DC source, the energy is stored in inductor and capacitor alternatively. This produces electrical oscillations of definite frequency.

**ii) _Amplifier_** This is a single stage amplifier which

amplifies the weak signal produced by the tank circuit. The required output is supplied by this amplifier.

**iii) _Feedback network_** The circuit used to feed a portion of the

output back to the input is called the feedback network. If the portion of the output fed to the input is in phase with the input, then the magnitude of the input signal increases. This process is called positive feedback which is necessary for sustained oscillations.

**Working** The tank circuit generates electrical

oscillations and acts as the AC input source to the transistor amplifier. Amplifier amplifies

the input AC signal. In practical oscillator circuits, there is loss of some energy in inductor coils and capacitors due to electrical resistance. A small amount of energy is used up in overcoming these losses during every cycle of charging and discharging of the capacitor. Due to this, the amplitude of the oscillations decreases gradually. Hence, the tank circuit produces damped electrical oscillations.

In order to produce undamped oscillations, a positive feedback is provided from output to input by feedback network. This compensates energy loss in tank circuit. The frequency of oscillations is determined by the values of L and C and is given by

_f LC_

\= 1 2π

(10.8)

**Barkhausen conditions for sustained oscillations**

The following conditions called Barkhausen conditions should be satisfied for sustained oscillations in the oscillator. · There should be positive feedback. · The loop phase shift must be 00 or integral

multiples of 2π. · The loop gain must be unity. That is,

_A_β =1. Here, _A_ is the voltage gain of the amplifier,

β is the feedback ratio (the fraction of the output that is fed back to the input).

There are different types of oscillator circuits based on the different types of tank circuits. Examples: Hartley oscillator, Colpitts oscillator, Phase shift oscillator and Crystal oscillator.

**Applications of oscillators** Transistor oscillators are used

· to generate periodic sinusoidal or non sinusoidal wave forms

· to generate RF carriers  

· to generate audio tones · to generate clock signal in digital circuits · as sweep circuits in TV sets and CRO

**10.5.1 Analog and Digital Signals**

There are 2 different types of signals used in Electronics. They are (i) Analog signals and (ii) Digital signals. An analog signal is a continuously varying voltage or current with respect to time. Such signals are employed in rectifying circuits and transistor amplifier circuits.

Digital signals are signals which contain only discrete values of voltages. Digital signals need two states: switch ON and OFF. ON is considered as one state and OFF is considered as the other state. It can also be defined as high (ON) or low (OFF) state, closed (ON) or open (OFF). These high and low states are defined using binary numbers 1 or 0 in Boolean Algebra. The state 1 represents the terms: circuit on, high voltage, a closed switch. Similarly a 0 state represents circuit off, low voltage or an open switch.

**Positive and Negative Logic** In digital systems, there exists two

voltage levels: 5V (high) and 0V (low). In a positive logic system; a binary 1 stands for 5V and 0 stands for 0V while in negative logic system, 1 stands for 0V and 0 stands for 5V as shown in Figure 10.40.

**10.5.2 Logic gates**

A logic gate is an electronic circuit whose function is based on digital signals. They are binary in nature. The logic gates are considered as the basic building blocks of most of the digital systems. They have one output with one or more inputs. There are three types of basic logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT. The other logic gates are Ex-OR, NAND, and NOR. They can be constructed from the basic logic gates.

Digital electronics deals with logical operations. The variables are called logical variables. The operators like logical addition (+) and logical multiplication (.) are called logical operators. When the logical operators (+, .) operate on logical variables (A, B), they give logical constant (Y). The equation that represents this operation is called logical statement.

For example,

Logical operator: +

Logical variable: _A, B_

Logical constant: _Y_

Logical statement: _Y_ = _A_ + _B_

The possible combinations of inputs and the corresponding output are given in the form of a table called truth table. The circuits which perform the basic logical operations such as logical addition, multiplication and inversion are discussed below.

**AND gate** _Circuit symbol_

The circuit symbol of a two input AND gate is shown in Figure 10.41(a). _A_ and _B_ are inputs and _Y_ is the output. It is a logic gate and hence _A_, _B_, and _Y_ can have the value of either 1 or 0.

NAND and NOR gates are known as universal gates because any other logic gate can be made from NAND or

NOR gates.

**BOOLEAN ALGEBRA**

Boolean Algebra is basically a choice between two options (i) yes or no (ii) high or low. These two options in Boolean algebra are represented by binary numbers 0 or 1. It is a concept that relates logic and mathematics which is a century old, made up by George Boole in 1854. Later the importance of Boolean algebra was realized in the design of computer circuits. Today we are in a digital world and most of the comforts that we experience is due to digitization with the foundation based on Boolean algebra.

The concept of high (1) and low (0) is not a new one. In fact, it was applied

in telephone switching circuits by Shannon in 1938.

**Laws of Boolean Algebra** The NOT, OR and AND operations

discussed in section 10.5.2 are the Boolean operations. The results of these operations can be summarised as:

**Complement law**

_A Y A_\=

0 _Y_ \= =0 1

1 _Y_ \= =1 0

The complement law can be realised as

_A A_\=

2nd law _A_ . 1 = _A_

3rd law _A_ . _A_ = _A_

4th law _A_ . _A_ = 0

The Boolean operations obey the following laws.

**Commutative laws**

_A + B = B + A A . B = B . A_

**Associative laws**

_A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C A . (B . C) = (A .B) . C_

**Distributive laws**

_A( B + C) = AB + AC A + BC = (A + B) (A + C)_  

The above laws are used to simplify complicated expressions and to simplify the logic circuitry.

**DE MORGAN’S THEOREM**

**10.7.1 De Morgan’s First Theorem**

**Statement** The first theorem states that the

complement of the sum of two logical inputs is equal to the product of its complements.

**Proof** The Boolean equation for NOR gate is

_Y A B_\= + .

The Boolean equation for a bubbled AND gate is _Y A B_\= . .

Both cases generate same outputs for same inputs. It can be verified using the following truth table.

_A B A+B A+B A B A . B_ 0 0 0 1 1 1 1

0 1 1 0 1 0 0

1 0 1 0 0 1 0

1 1 1 0 0 0 0

From the above truth table, we can conclude _A B A B_\+ = . .

Thus De Morgan’s first theorem is proved. Hence, a NOR gate is equal to a bubbled AND gate.

The corresponding logic circuit diagram is shown in Figure 10.47.

**10.7.2 De Morgan’s Second Theorem**

**Statement** The second theorem states that the

**Proof** The Boolean equation for NAND gate is

_Y A B_\= . . The Boolean equation for bubbled OR

gate is _Y A B_\= + . _A_ and _B_ are the inputs and _Y_ is the output.

The above two equations produces the same output for the same inputs. It can be verified by using the truth table

**10.7.3 Integrated Chips**

An integrated circuit is also referred as an IC or a chip or a microchip (Figure 10.49). It consists of thousands to millions of transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc. integrated on a small flat piece of semiconductor material that is normally silicon.

Integrated circuits (ICs) are the keystone of modern electronics. With the advancement in technology and the emergence of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) era it is possible to fit more and more transistors on chips of same piece.

ICs have two main advantages over ordinary circuits: cost and performance. The size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously with the advancement in technology. Computers, mobile phones, and other digital home appliances are now made possible by the

small size and low cost of ICs. ICs can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer, microprocessor and computer memory.

These extremely small ICs can perform calculations and store data using either digital or analog technology. Digital ICs use logic gates, which work only with values of ones and zeros. A low signal sent to a component on a digital IC will result in a value of 0, while a high signal creates a value of 1.

**Digital ICs** usually find their applications in computers, networking equipment, and most consumer electronics. **Analog ICs** or linear ICs work with continuous values. This means a component on a linear IC can take any value and output another value. Linear ICs are typically used in audio and radio frequency amplification.

## COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

**Introduction Communication is the process of**

**exchanging information by speaking, writing or using some other medium**.

Communication has existed since the dawn of life in this world. Growth in science and technology removed the locational disadvantage effectively. Information can be exchanged from one person to another anywhere on this Earth. Right from the researches done in communication by great scientists like J.C. Bose, G. Marconi and Alexander Graham Bell, communication has witnessed development by leaps and bounds. The communication industry is one of the largest in size and is the oldest since communication through telegraph (1844), telephone (1876), and Radio (1887) started centuries back.

The intensive research in the mid- and late nineteenth century has led to the development of long-distance transmission in the shortest possible time. However, the 20th century witnessed a leap over the development of communication, meeting the demands of speed and secured transfer of data. This section provides a glimpse of the basic concepts of electronic communication, some important communication systems and their applications.

**10.9**

**MODULATION**

The transmission of information through short distances does not require




  

complicated techniques. The energy of the information signal is sufficient enough to be sent directly. However if the information in the audio frequency range (20 to 20,000 Hz) needs to be transmitted to long distances across the world, certain techniques are required to transmit the information without any loss.

**For long distance transmission, the low frequency baseband signal (input signal) is superimposed onto a high frequency radio signal by a process called modulation.** In the modulation process, a very high frequency signal called carrier signal (radio signal) is used to carry the baseband signal.

As the frequency of the carrier signal is very high, it can be transmitted to long distances with less attenuation. The carrier signal is usually a sine wave signal.

A sinusoidal carrier wave can be represented as _ec_ = _Ec_ sin (2π_νc_ _t_ \+ ϕ), where _Ec_ is the amplitude, _νc_ is the frequency and ϕ is the initial phase of the carrier wave at any instant of time _t_.

Three characteristics in the carrier signal can be modified by the baseband signal during the process of modulation: amplitude, frequency and phase of the carrier signal.

Accordingly, we have (i) amplitude modulation, (ii) frequency modulation and (iii) phase modulation.

**10.9.1 AMPLITUDE MODULATION (AM)**

**If the amplitude of the carrier signal is modified in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the baseband signal, then it is called amplitude modulation.** Here the frequency and the  

phase of the carrier signal remain constant. Amplitude modulation is used in radio and TV broadcasting.

The signal shown in Figure 10.50(a) is the baseband signal that carries information. Figure 10.50(b) shows the high-frequency carrier signal and Figure 10.50(c) gives amplitude modulated signal. We can see that amplitude of the carrier wave is modified in proportion to the amplitude of the baseband signal.

**10.9.2 FREQUENCY MODULATION (FM)**

**The frequency of the carrier signal is modified in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the baseband signal in frequency modulation.** Here the amplitude and the phase of the carrier signal remain constant.

The increase in the amplitude of the baseband signal increases the frequency of the carrier signal and vice versa. This leads to compressions and rarefactions in the frequency spectrum of the modulated wave as shown in Figure 10.51. Louder signal leads to compressions and relatively weaker signals to rarefactions.

**Figure 10.51** Frequency Modulation (a) Baseband signal (b) Carrier signal (c) Frequency modulated signal

When the amplitude of the baseband signal is zero in Figure 10.51(a), the frequency of the modulated signal is the same as the carrier signal. The frequency of the modulated wave increases when the  

amplitude of the baseband signal increases in the positive direction (A, C). The increase in amplitude in the negative half cycle (B, D) reduces the frequency of the modulated wave (Figure 10.51(c)).

When the frequency of the baseband signal is zero (no input signal), there is no change in the frequency of the carrier wave. It is at its normal frequency and is called as **centre frequency or resting frequency.** Practically this is the allotted frequency of the FM transmitter.

**Advantages of FM** i) In FM, there is a large decrease in

noise. This leads to an increase in signal- noise ratio.

ii) The operating range is quite large. iii) The transmission efficiency is very

high as all the transmitted power is useful. iv) FM bandwidth covers the entire

frequency range which humans can hear. Due to this, FM radio has better quality compared to AM radio.

**Limitations of FM** i) FM requires a much wider channel. ii) FM transmitters and receivers are

more complex and costly. iii) In FM reception, less area is covered

compared to AM.

**10.9.3 PHASE MODULATION (PM)**

**In phase modulation, the instantaneous amplitude of the baseband signal modifies the phase of the carrier signal keeping its amplitude and frequency constant**. This modulation is used to generate frequency modulated signals. It is similar to frequency modulation except that the phase of the carrier is varied instead of varying frequency.




  

## THE ELEMENTS OF AN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

Electronics plays a major role in communication. Electronic communication is nothing but the transmission of sound, text, pictures, or data through a medium. Long distance transmission uses free space as a medium.

The elements of the basic communication system are explained with the block diagram shown in Figure 10.52.

**i) Information (Baseband or input signal)** Information can be in the form of

speech, music, pictures or computer data. This information is given as input to the input transducer.

**ii) Input transducer** In communication system, the

transducer converts the information (in the form of sound, music, pictures or computer data) into corresponding electrical signals. **The electrical equivalent of the original information is called the baseband signal.**

The best example for the transducer is the microphone that converts sound energy into electrical energy.

**iii) Transmitter** It feeds the electrical signal from the

transducer to the communication channel. It consists of circuits such as amplifier, oscillator, modulator and power amplifier. The transmitter is located at the broadcasting station.

**Amplifier**: The transducer output is very weak and is amplified by the amplifier.

**Oscillator**: It generates high-frequency carrier wave (a sinusoidal wave) for long distance transmission into space. As the energy of a wave is proportional to its frequency, the carrier wave has very high energy.

**Modulator**: It superimposes the baseband signal onto the carrier signal and generates the modulated signal.

**Power amplifier**: It increases the power level of the electrical signal in order to cover a large distance.

**iv) Transmitting antenna** It radiates the radio signal into space

in all directions. It travels in the form of electromagnetic waves with the speed of light.

**v) Communication channel** Communication channel is used to carry

the electrical signal from transmitter to receiver with less noise or distortion. The examples for communication medium are wires, cables, optical fibres in wireline communication and free space in wireless communication.

**vi) Receiver** The signals that are transmitted through

the communication medium are received by a receiving antenna which converts EM waves into RF signals and are fed into the receiver.

The receiver consists of electronic circuits like demodulator, amplifier etc. The demodulator extracts the baseband signal from the modulated signal. Then the baseband signal is amplified using amplifier. Finally, it is fed to the output transducer.

**vii) Repeaters** Repeaters are used to increase the range or

distance through which the signals are sent. It is a combination of transmitter and receiver. The signals are received, amplified and  

retransmitted with a carrier signal of different frequency to the destination. The best example is the communication satellite in space.

**viii) Output transducer** It converts the electrical signal back to its

original form such as sound, music, pictures or data. Examples of output transducers are loudspeakers, picture tubes, computer monitor etc.

**10.10.1 BASIC DEFINITIONS IN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEM**

For better understanding of the communication systems, it is essential to know about the following terms.

**i) Range** It is the maximum distance between the

source and the destination up to which the signal is received with sufficient strength.

**ii) Noise** It is the undesirable electrical signal

that interferes with the transmitted signal. Noise attenuates or reduces the quality of the transmitted signal. It may be man- made (automobiles, welding machines, electric motors etc.) or natural (lightning, environmental effects, radiation from sun and stars). Noise cannot be completely eliminated. However, it can be reduced using various techniques.

**iii) Attenuation** The loss of strength of a signal while

propagating through a medium is known as attenuation.

**iv) Bandwidth** The frequency range over which the

baseband signals or the information




  

signals such as voice, music, picture etc are transmitted is known as bandwidth. If _ν_1 and _ν_2 are the lower and upper-frequency limits of a signal, then the bandwidth, BW **=** _ν_2 – _ν_1.

**v) Bandwidth of transmission system** The range of frequencies required to

transmit a piece of specified information in a particular channel is called channel bandwidth or the bandwidth of the transmission system.

## PROPAGATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

The electromagnetic wave transmitted by the transmitter travels in three different modes to reach the receiver according to its frequency range. They are

• Ground wave propagation (or) surface wave propagation (nearly 2 kHz to 2 MHz)

• Sky wave propagation (or) ionospheric propagation (nearly 3 MHz to 30 MHz)

• Space wave propagation (nearly 30 MHz to 400 GHz)

**i) Ground wave propagation If the electromagnetic waves**

**transmitted by the transmitter glide over the surface of the Earth to reach the receiver, then the propagation is called ground wave propagation. The corresponding waves are called ground waves or surface waves.** The pictorial representation is shown in Figure 10.53(a). Here both transmitting and receiving antennas must be close to the Earth's surface.

It is mainly used in local broadcasting, radio navigation, for ship-to-ship, ship-  

to-shore communication and mobile communication.

**ii) Sky wave propagation The mode of propagation in which**

**the electromagnetic waves radiated from an antenna, directed upwards at large angles, gets reflected by the ionosphere back to Earth is called sky wave propagation or ionospheric propagation. The corresponding waves are called sky waves** (Figure 10.53(b)).

Ionosphere acts as a reflecting surface. It is at a distance of approximately 50 km and spreads up to 400 km above the Earth's surface. Due to the absorption of ultraviolet rays, cosmic ray, and other high energy radiations like α, β rays from sun, the air molecules in the ionosphere get ionized. This produces charged ions and these

ions provide a reflecting medium for the reflection of radio waves or communication waves back to Earth within the permitted frequency range. The phenomenon of bending the radio waves back to Earth is nothing but the total internal reflection.

When the angle of incidence at the ionosphere is large, the sky wave returns to the ground at a long distance from the transmitter. As this angle is reduced, the wave returns closer and closer to the transmitter. If the angle of incidence is reduced further, the radio waves penetrate through the ionosphere. For a particular angle of incidence, the point of reception (B) is at the minimum distance from transmitter. **The shortest distance between the transmitter and the point of reception of the sky wave along the surface is called as the skip distance**.

The ground waves get attenuated as they move away from the transmitter. At a particular point (A), there is no reception ground wave. **The zone (in between A and B) where there is no reception of electromagnetic waves neither ground nor sky is known as skip zone or skip area** (Figure 10.53(b)).

**iii) Space wave propagation The process of sending and receiving**

**information signal through space is called space wave communication** (Figure 10.53(c)). **The electromagnetic waves of very high frequencies above 30 MHz are called as space waves.** These waves travel in a straight line from the transmitter to the receiver. Hence, it is used for a line of sight communication (LOS).

The communication systems like television telecast, satellite communication and RADAR are based on space wave propagation.  

The range or distance (d) of coverage of the propagation depends on the height (h) of the antenna given by the equation,

_d Rh_\= 2 (10.9)

where R is the radius of the Earth. The distance of coverage is shown pictorially in Figure 10.54.

**d**

**h**

**Figure 10.54** Distance of coverage

## SOME IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

There are a large number of communication systems available in the market for varied purposes. Here some of the important communication systems are introduced and their applications are briefly discussed.

**10.12.1 SATELLITE AND ITS COMMUNICATION**

The satellite communication is a mode of transmission of the signal between transmitter and receiver via satellite. The message signal from the Earth station is transmitted to the satellite on board via an uplink (frequency band 6 GHz), amplified by a transponder and then retransmitted to another Earth station via a downlink (frequency band 4 GHz) (Figure 10.55).

**Applications** Satellites are classified into different

types based on their applications.  

i) **Weather satellites:** They are used to monitor the weather and climate of Earth. By measuring cloud mass, these satellites enable us to predict rain and dangerous storms like hurricanes, cyclones etc.

ii) **Communication satellites:** They are used to transmit television, radio, internet signals etc. Multiple satellites are used for long distance communication.

iii) **Navigation satellites:** These are employed to determine the geographic location of ships, aircrafts or any other object.

**10.12.2 FIBRE OPTIC COMMUNICATION**

**The method of transmitting information from one place to another in terms of light pulses through an optical fiber is called fiber optic communication.** It works on the principle of total internal reflection.

**Figure 10.56 Optical fibers**

**Applications** Optical fiber system has a number

of applications namely, international communication, inter-city communication, data links, plant and traffic control and defense applications.

**Merits** i) Fiber cables are very thin and weigh

less than copper cables. ii) This system has much larger band

width. This means that its information carrying capacity is larger.

iii) Fiber optic system is immune to electrical interferences.

iv) Fiber optic cables are cheaper than copper cables.

**Demerits** i) Fiber optic cables are more fragile

when compared to copper wires. ii) It is an expensive technology.

**10.12.3 RADAR AND APPLICATIONS**

**Radar basically stands for Radio Detection and Ranging System.** It is one of the important applications of communication systems and is mainly used to sense, detect, and locate distant objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft, etc. The angle, range or velocity of  

the objects that are invisible to the human eye can be determined.

Radar uses electromagnetic waves for communication. The electromagnetic signal is initially radiated into space by an antenna in all directions. When this signal strikes the targeted object, it gets reflected or reradiated in many directions. This reflected (echo) signal is received by the radar antenna which in turn is delivered to the receiver. Then, it is processed and amplified to determine the geographical statistics of the object. The range is determined by calculating the time taken by the signal to travel from RADAR to the target and back.

**Applications** Radars find extensive applications in

many fields. i) In military, it is used for locating and

detecting the targets. ii) It is used in navigation systems such

as ship borne surface search, air search and missile guidance systems.

iii) Radars are used to measure precipitation rate and wind speed in meteorological observations.

iv) It is employed to locate and rescue people in emergency situations.

**10.12.4 MOBILE COMMUNICATION**

**Mobile communication is used to communicate with others in different locations without the use of any physical connection like wires or cables.** It allows the transmission over a wide range of area without the use of the physical link. It enables the people to communicate with each other regardless of a particular location like office, house etc. It also provides communication access to remote areas.




  

**Figure 10.57** Mobile communication

It provides the facility of roaming – that is, the user may move from one place to another without the need of compromising on the communication. The maintenance and cost of installation of this communication network are also cheap.

**Applications** i) It is used for personal communication

and cellular phones offer voice and data connectivity with high speed.

ii) Transmission of news across the globe is done within a few seconds.

iii) Using Internet of Things (IoT), it is made possible to control various devices from a single device. Example: home automation using a mobile phone.  

iv) It enables smart classrooms, online availability of notes, monitoring student activities etc. in the field of education.

**10.12.5 INTERNET**

Internet is a fast growing technology in the field of communication system with multifaceted tools. It provides new ways and means to interact and connect with people.
